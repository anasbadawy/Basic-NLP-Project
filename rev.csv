B007GB7PB8,Sandy Kay,Flavor didn't work for me; back to Honey Nut,"I was really looking forward to the Dulce de Leche Cheerios.  The Honey Nut flavor has been my favorite since they came out and the thought of caramel was quite appealing. The first few spoonfuls seemed quite yummy.  But the more I ate, the less I enjoyed it.  The caramel flavor seemed a bit off to me or maybe it was that these are more corn than oat so the flavor was different from that as well.  (Oats are the third ingredient after corn and sugar; I thought Cheerios were always oat cereals.) All things considered (especially price), I'll stick with Honey Nut. They tasted pretty good just plain from the box so I think I'll save them for when I want a slightly sweet snack but not too sugary.  I'll pour out a handful and eat them like a toddler! I expected these to be more sugary than the Honey Nut but these have 6 grams of sugar per serving compared to 9 grams for the Honey Nut.  But they have the same total carbohydrates, 22 grams per serving, so there isn't much difference in how it affects your body. Bottom line:  I won't buy them again.",
B0005ZWBPC,Kimberli,Delicious Treat!!!,"I became addicted to eating these the first time I tasted them which was years ago. Once you eat one, you just can't stop until they're gone. They aren't too sweet and make the perfect snack. I love these things!!!",
B0005ZWBPC,"Ruhama ""Bibliophilia""",Passover treat,"My synagogue's Passover Care Package had some of these candies in it, and WOW are they good!  Americans have little exposure to sesame seeds except atop a burger bun.  Time to taste these nutty little wonders!  Individually wrapped to keep them fresh and slow you down (grins).  Better than peanut brittle any day!  And these are kosher for passover!",
B0043JF3II,Karen R,Not particularly good,"I've had many types of pepper jelly, and this is by far the worst ever. The price is high, and the taste is not good. The shipping was outrageous. More costly than the green pepper jelly. Don't waste you money.",
B0025ULYKI,History buff,Sooo Good!!,"These are some of my favorite chips on the planet! They are light, crisp, & not too greasy. The flavor is very Dilly. Love that! Great chips. Just hard to find.",
B0025ULYKI,Woofie53,These are soooo good!!,"These chips are really good. They taste better than other name brands. They're cheaper too!!  They aren't too salty like other brands. The flavors blend really well. Just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in. Once I start eating them, it's hard to stop!! LOL I will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand. Not sure if I can state the name brand or not. :)",
B0025ULYKI,"drhughes ""drhughes""",OPEN BAG OF CHIPS!!!,"4 bags of chips were open when I received the shipment. I am hoping that the chips were blew open during shipment in flight.  No more chips for me through Amazon.  Otherwise,the chips are good to eat and very salty.",
B0025ULYKI,swootchie,college student gourmet,"Not as thick as kettle chips we have had in the past, definitely more like a potato chip and the college crowd loves it.  Interestingly enough they feel more 'gourmet' when eating these. The flavor is not heavily garlic while you can easily taste the cheese.",
B0025ULYKI,Pfred,Uncle rays without much taste,"We have ordered Uncle Rays BBQ chips many times before. Always been pleased, except this order!  Just NOT the same Seasoning as usual. Generally lacked much for taste! Not sure if they have reduced the seasoning, in their processing? But out of case we bought, we have opened and thrown away 3 bags already, VERY disappointed with this order!",
B0025ULYKI,"MadisonVeggie ""Lynette in Wisconsin""",These sure don't taste like ketchup to me!,"I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!",
B0025ULYKI,Mickey,Great Chips!!,"I thought they were very good chips, delicious!  and as soon as i run out, i'll be ordering more very soon.",
B0025ULYKI,chari,Where's the vinegar?,"After reading all the good reviews on these chips I have to admit I was disappointed. Perhaps I just ended up with a bad batch, but I could barely taste the vinegar and there seemed to be far too many burnt (and I mean BLACK) chips in these bags. Hopefully the other flavors are better, but I'm going to stick with other brands from now on.",
B0025ULYKI,"Jackie D. Depalm ""jackie d""",Uncle Ray's Kosher Dill Potato chips,"These are hard to find, but worth the trouble.  Very tasty and very reasonably priced.  Love the product, and received very quickly.",
B0025ULYKI,charlene crowley,uncle rays barbeque chips,"I love uncle ray's potatoe chips. They have alot of spice on each chip.  They taste spicy with a tang of sweet. When I order a box, I pass them out to friends who love them. My husband, my kids and I eat a whole bag at a time.  I limit myself to ordering only twice ayear. The salt content makes me blow up, but I still love them.",
B0025ULYKI,C. Matas,Not quite Old Dutch but much better than Herr's,"I LOVE Old Dutch Ketchup chips but they are no where to be found in the US and pricey on eBay.  I tried Herr's but they were dull - very ketchupy but not the tangy-vinigary ketchup bite that Old Dutch has (makes your mouth hurt  in a good way if you eat too many!).  Uncle Rays are decent - more of a kick - many ""loaded"" chips which I like, still, not the addictive bite I love.  So - if you love Herr's these may be too much for you.  If you love Old Dutch give these a shot.  I am still on my quest for something equal to Old Dutch!!",
B0025ULYKI,SimpleSins,Tasty Chips,"I confess, I was originally looking at a different ""name"" brand, but they were out of the salt and vinegar, which is the only flavor I eat.  I had never even heard of Uncle Ray's, let alone tried them, but the price was reasonable and it helped me qualify for free super saver shipping.  I am happy to say I was very pleasantly surprised with these chips.  Somehow or another, even though they just seem to be in a normal box, when I opened that first bag I had a nice mix of big chips and little chips.  The salt and vinegar blend well, so much so that the flavors sometimes sneak up on you-- it sometimes seems that with the first crunch you taste salt and the second crunch gives the vinegar.  In any case, they're terrific.  I was a little reluctant about buying a somewhat large quantity of an unknown product, but I'm very glad I took the chance.",
B0025ULYKI,"Texas Jack ""T J""",Great chips!  Great flavor!,"It's difficult to purchase ""no-salt"" potato chips at most retail stores, so I ordered a case of 3 ounce bags of Uncle Rays.  They are great.  Not oily and they taste great.  You get the potato flavor instead of just salt.  I'll be buying these from now on!",
B0025ULYKI,"Jonella A. Moore ""artbellamama""",Uncle Ray's BBQ chips are the best!,"We can rarely find these potato chips where we live, so I decided to find them online to satisfy our cravings. We cannot be happier with the ordering from Amazon! The chips arrived fast and in a box that protected them from crushing. Excellent and will be ordering again!",
B0025ULYKI,The Hot King Jr,They were so good until more people bought them and now meh,These had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning. The first 2 cases were amazing best i had ever. Then they restocked and tried 4-5 cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them. What a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money. Bad Uncle Ray!,
B0025ULYKI,cameokid,"Ketchup powdery coating excessive, overdone gritty","The flavor combination of the ketchup chips was very good.  However, the coating was applied so heavily that the chips were gritty, and thickly encrusted with it. The flavoring grit coated my lips and mouth with grit and crumbled and fell off all over my clothes.  Messy and unpleasant.  Needs lighter flavor coating.",
B0025ULYKI,"Thomas A. Roberts ""tomrgalvtx""",Good chips--nothing special,"The Uncle Ray's BBQ Potato Chips are comparable to Lays or most commonly available chips in local markets.  The BBQ spice ia a bit too much; the one pound bags consisted of about half broken chips.  I won't think about buying these again, even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip.",
B0025ULYKI,onlyme,PLEASE!!!!!Don't waste your money,"Bought Uncle Ray's Wavy's 16 oz potato chips because purchased  Uncle Ray's 16 oz barbque potato chips in the past and was very pleased. Oh how wrong we were.  Do not purchase the Wavy's chips!!!!!!!!!!  They are the quality of buying a no name bag of chips from a roadside service station store; broken, brown, very poor quality.  Very, very disappointed.  DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT purchase Uncle Ray's 16 oz Wavy potato chips OCTOBER 03, 2012 Bought Uncle Ray's sour cream and onion flavored chips for the 5th shipment with extreme disappointment. The other (4) four shipments were very good which is why we continued to buy this flavor. The additive that when you like an item and start to buy a lot, it will change for the worse is proving to be true for us.  This shipment of chips are awful.  Bags are extremely deflated, so was expecting to be stale; however, was not so - cannot not explain the semi-flat bags.  Chips seem to be the bottom of the barrel flakes.  You know when you try to salt your food and the top comes off, the seasoning on these chips is like that.  It appears that the top came off a full bottle or these are the bottom of the barrel crumbled chips where the seasoning has covered the chips too, too much. .  We just opened (3)three bags just now because the first bags was awful, opened second bag - awful, opened 3rd bag - also was awful.  LEFT WITH 6 MORE ,PROBABLY NOT EDIBLE, BAGS. THE CHIPS REALLY APPEAR TO BE THE NOT SO FRESH, BURNED/BOTTOM OF THE BARREL, GET RID OF LEFTOVERS.  VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED.  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
B003UDV9SG,Research Hound,Good brand of food,"I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.)",

B0028SWACS,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""",Quality white tea with added unusual flavors,"Just in case, if anyone doesn't know what WHITE tea is, as opposed to green or black, let's quote Wikipedia: ""white tea is fast-dried, while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan (while kept moving for even curing). Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing."" What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties. This particular product, while it comes in tea bags, it's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety. Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder. This being a white tea, 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet, green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If it's not 'love at the first sip', give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not. INGREDIENTS: - organic, fair trade certified White Tea  - natural Lychee flavor  - organic Osmanthus flavor  - contains caffeine The somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer. Time will tell but at this time 3 stars (meaning 'it's Okay') seem to be the fair rating.",
B0028SWACS,"a metaphysician ""of erudition""",Smells like Heaven ,"As soon as I opened the teabag envelope, the smell was truly Divine Nasal Candy .  As good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled, the tea proved to be rather bitter.  I may have steeped it too long, so will see if the bitterness abates steeping less.  However, as I prefer milk or cream products in flower teas, the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had.  Lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea.  I suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea.  Will definitely reorder.",
B0028SWACS,"R. W. ""RW""",Sublime Fragrance and Taste,"If you're looking at Choice tea, you're probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic, fair trade ingredients for tea.But Choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations. As for design, Lychee White is part of Choice's new line, characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid-shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves. As for creative ingredient combinations, this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms. The flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate.",
B0028SWACS,careful shopper,one of the best,"Sent very prompty, tea is delicious, will continue to use this company with great enthusiasm.",

B003UDSXU8,jaime b.,jolokia salsa review,this salsa is definitely one for the books!! A perfect blend of the jolokia pepper and seasonings that made this the perfect dip for half-time.. Grown men crying because it's soooo hot is a small price to pay for this awesomeness in a jar  perfect for my cream cheese dip too! A+ across the board.,
B003UDSXU8,Zachary A Wallace,Spicy,"This salsa was delicious. It was very spicy as I'm sure you've guessed, but was also pretty dang tasty. It was a bit sweeter than I prefer my salsa and given the price I don't think it is something I would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing, you just might end up loving it!",
B003UDSXU8,VincePSP,One of the best salsas!!,"Nice combination of ingredients so that it is VERY hot, yet still has great flavor. It has a little added sugar, which adds a nice bit of sweetness to the mix. For the hotter salsas, you really can't go wrong with this. This is one of my top four favorites, which include Mrs. Renfros hot salsa, Screaming Sphincter and Pain is Good #37.",
B003UDSXU8,Mustache Mystery,The mouth is strong the anus is weaker,"I am very acustom to spicy foods and this has a very rich flavor. Half the bottle was devoted to given people my ""not so hot salsa "" reactions amazing . Worth the money! as for me eating it the title says it all",
B002OHOC6A,Eric Nichols,My cats love it,"My cats (7 of them) love this food so I was glad to see Amazon is carrying it again. The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.5lbs and 12 lbs. This food is sealed very well, and is fresh. I have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food, and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats. This food does not ""rifle"" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives brand and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free. I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now. If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust. In the end, I think you will be very pleased with the quality and price. Also, we used to take in foster cats, and fed them this 9 Lives brand, and they all did very well.",

B002OHOC6A,Rom Gin,Great Value,"There are 4 kittens that started hanging outside the house and I started feeding them.  Rather than buying the smaller bags, this is a great value for multiple cats.

B002OHOC6A,leah m orourke,Great deal,My cats love this food. For the money it is a great product. I get it every month.  The cats love the flavor.,
B002OHOC6A,"Linda M. Johnson ""LinnyLouWo""","Low quality ingredients, but ","As the ingredients contained in this food are not the optimal food sources essential to a cat's well being, I don't actually feed my cats this dry food. Corn is the first ingredient, which is a food my cats really don't crave.  There is a meat source as the second ingredient, but unfortunately, it is a by-product.  Although there are a couple of other meat sources listed in the ingredients, the addition of artificial preservatives and coloring make this cat food a less than desirable food staple for any cat. However, the Amazon price is good and with Amazon prime 2-day free shipping directly to work, this is a very convenient food for the shop cats I feed.  While the ingredients aren't the best, feeding it along with canned food, it is a balanced diet and seems to keep the shop cats healthy.",
B002OHOC6A,Karen Edwards,Cats love it,"I have 6 feral cats that I trapped, neutered/spayed and released.  They still hang around our property so of course we feed them.  They really like 9 lives and I believe it is good for them.  Being old and my husband handicapped, it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of wrestling with the bags at the store and unloading when we get home.

Robert Bois'"" positive experience / review was written but before the date of ""Cindy 2366's"" positive experience / written review.  I bought these & gave them to my Dad, as he *LOVES* dates.  I noticed when I was visiting him, the dried fruit basket was hanging around in his 'fridge a lot longer than any other date basket I had ever ordered for him. Finally I asked him about them.  He said that he did not want to be rude to me or hurt my feelings but .  the dates, well, he was wondering if he should try & eat the seeds in the center & see if they were soft, because the dates themselves were hard as a rock & tasted stale.  I was mortified to say the least   Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment.  (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.)  Me personally, I have not tried them.  I will take his word for it!  :) I told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels.  After a week of offering the dates,  I picked them up out of his backyard and threw them away.  The squirrels, opossums, & raccoons declined to dine on the dates. It seems to be hit or miss with the ""Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patrick's Dried Fruit Gift Basket"" purchase. I will not say flat out ""NO!  Do Not Purchase This Item, It is Not Good!""  That is a choice you will have to make on your own.  I just wanted to pass along my experience with the gift basket.

B004IF3TAQ,Mommyohs,Not nearly as good as Bissinger's French Long,"After searching for a more constant and less expensive supply of ""real"" licorice over my favorite (more about that later), I decided to try this one based upon other reviews and the description. I have to say that I was disappointed. It is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that I noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which I would charactize as ""modest"". My all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a St. Louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by Bissinger's Chocolate Company and they call it French Long Licorice. It is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky-sweet candy. I say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite ""type"" of licorice; this is important when reading reviews and purchasing. I was looking for something not American-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones. As far a Bissinger's is concerned, they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production. It is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability (I can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if I don't chew). These are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and I limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my ""fix""; okay, sometimes 3 if it is a superb book:D.  The last time I ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank-you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because I do not live near one of their stores and unless I visit say St. Louis (where it is headquartered) I have to mail-order.Anyway, I prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when I get an order ($56 for 2lbs) I leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off. That makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference. It frezes without problems so I will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up :). Licorice-gotta have it!",

B000IUOBMA,Roxanne,Must Have Been Spoiled,"This was a disappointment.  I use other products from this line/manufacturer on a regular basis.  I bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid Stevia in my purse.  The first time I went to use it, the liquid was a dark color almost black..and I had to throw out the latte I was trying to sweeten.  All the manufacturer's other liquid products are clear, and, in fact, this is titled ""clear liquid"".  It must have been outdated/spoiled. I had already thrown the packing out, so don't know how it was dated.  I tried calling the Amazon supplier, but the call rolled into voice mail.  It's not enough money to spend time following-up, but it was disappointing.",
B001HTI226,a work in progress,Bisphenol A,Cans are lined w/ material that contains BPA which means the effort to grow the tomatoes organically was a waste of time. 12-5-10  I didn't see the liner when I opened a different can from the same case.  I'm scratching my head.,
B001HTI226,Christie Hall,Spectacular tomatoes,"These tomatoes taste like home canned. When summer is over and heirloom tomatoes no longer are available at the farmers market, these serve as an excellent reminder of the past season and a promise of the next. I originally bought these organic tomatoes for my stepfather, whose heart disease dictated a low sodium diet. And they are incredibly low in sodium. But I soon bought them for myself after I tried them just once. When the local organic grocery store and then Sprouts stopped carrying them, I turned to Amazon for a case. They are as much a staple in my pantry as olive oil.",
B001HTI226,Sincerely Yours,Next best thing to fresh tomatoes,"the ingredients are simple and pure and one of the few brands that does not add unnecessary additives.  Generally I like to make my own sauce from scratch, but this is my second choice if I am short on time.  Its taste good and not artificially sweet.  I love the bionaturae products including the tomato paste.",
B001HTI226,Michael D,Excellent tomatoes,"These are the best canned tomatoes I have tasted. They have a fresh flavor, similar to home-canned. This is my second time buying a set.

If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However, from the picture these looked well made. The picture is very deceiving and so is the description. They show 16 same-colored lollipops mine came in a variety of colors. They also gave dimentions that the lollipops were 6""x2"". I noticed they looked a bit small and when I measured they didn't even come to 5"" long, not any of them even though they're all differnet lengths.  This was very disappointing since I planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops.

The fact that these are made in China needs to be highlighted much more clearly.",

I could have saved money by ordering them directly from Oriental Trading Company which is clearly where they came from. they look cheap and they're not as colorful as shown in the picture. the Oriental Trading Company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops. most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken. the box only has 12 lollipops, but in the description it says there's 16. I would have expected that if I knew they were coming from Oriental Trading Company, but that's not in the description, so I feel ripped off.",
B00283V4GQ,Ace,Great service,"I had purchased these to go along with a Candyland costume for Halloween.  They shipped quickly and were packaged securely with bubble wrap.  None of the lollipops were broken in transit. It turns out the costume I ordered (from another seller) didn't fit at all and was made of very cheap material so I couldn't even alter it to fit.  Since I had to return the costume, I requested to return these as well.  I was immediately fully refunded without even being asked to ship the lollipops back, so the five stars are so the amazing service. Now I think we'll hand out the lollipops with the rest of our Halloween candy, which I think the kids in our neighborhood will love!",

B00283V4GQ,Caelis,"Slightly funny taste to begin with, but I can't stop eating them!","Being the candy-lover that I am, I wanted to buy some cute lollipops that I could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever I felt like it. For that purpose alone, I'd give them five stars. However- at first lick, the lollipop has a slightly off taste; but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way. I laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are 'Made in China'- I'm not dead/dying/sick. Good enough? As well, the text on the wrapper is fine- I wasn't repulsed by it and I'm not afraid to share. I'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating.  The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed- so they do not have that shiny look that many others have. None of mine came broken, and they were well-wrapped. I'm happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all(minus the few that I share with friends), but I'd try something different next time.",

B00283V4GQ,JenniferG,Very cute pops,"I ordered the lollipops for party favors at my son's 1st birthday party.  The lollipops are 2 inches and I used 1.5 inch ""thank you"" stickers on them.  So cute!  The description states that 16 lollipops are included in the order.  I ordered 2 boxes and only received 12 lollipops in each box.  I contacted the seller's customer service.  I received a response and apology right away.  They promptly corrected the order.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive another full box of 12 and not just the 8 I expected.  The lollipops are wrapped in bubble wrap.  Out of three boxes only one lollipop was cracked.  Not a big deal to me since I did receive an extra box.  Great lollipop at a great price.",
B00283V4GQ,mamacella,Shipping,"I opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke, I was very disappointed.  They did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking.  You are better off buying them from a store around your area.",

We are new to the Dixie Carb Counters line, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent taste.  Some of the other low carb lines (like Atkins) have a terrible aftertaste, or require the user to have a great imagination. (Yes .this is really supposed to be a chocolate bar.)  But the Dixie Carb items are great.  Easy to make, nice portion size, great taste, and no imagination required.  It really is a muffin!  And no sugar alcohol!  My only issue is that they are a little pricey.  Otherwise perfect!",

B008L19ZQ0,Shanna,Favorite thing about Brazil,"I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold. Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong.",

B005O072PC,"Richard T. Toohey ""Army man 2e""",Over Rated (way over priced)Frozen meats,"For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.

B005O072PC,"Captain Cap ""Captain Cap""",A+,"I received 4 of these in my first ever Omaha Steaks order that I received today. I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.",

B005O072PC,Daphne,Au Gratin Potatoes,"January 3, 2011 I purchased these potatoes from Omaha Steaks online last week. I was not sure what to expect   The au gratin potatoes I had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly wasn't it   I opened the box and got out my skillet. The first thing that I noticed is that these things were huge   like a gigantic tater tot. I browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. To my surprise, they were very tasty. Texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. I liked them alot. I think these are perfect for kids   none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture   I give these 4 stars.",

They claim it's a lot of caffeine, but it doesn't feel like more than a big coffee or a large energy drink, so I usually give in to the temptation! I highly recommend these!",

B002G8N4ZW,Glenn K.,Great Product! This is REAL Garlic Juice!,"I originally found this Roasted Garlic Juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs, plants and ice cream. That was about a year ago and unfortunately, the place is now out of business. I was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on Amazon, as I couldn't find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50-mile radius. Store Managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice. I told them if they carried it, they would sell a lot. I have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor can't be beat! It is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine. I prefer the Roasted over the Cold Pressed, but both are great in their own way. It's nice to be able to pour or spray. Bottom line: If you are a garlic lover, buy this!!!!!",

I recommend this tea highly, particularly if you like prickly pear teas.",
B000OK7UDG,J. Fischer,Can't detect the prickly pear,"Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear ""flavor"".

The first time I used this frosting I was disappointed, but a year has gone by and I thought that maybe I had gotten a bad container.  I really should have thought twice about buying it again, but I wanted to give Pillsbury the benefit of the doubt.  Boy was I wrong in doing that.  Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!  This product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting, the recipe needs tweaked, or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together.  Shame on me for trying it a second time!",

I DID purchase a large quantity of Bird's custard power, the pack of six, but the packs have a longish shelf life, and I enjoyed sending a surprise pack/container to a friend who is originally from England. At Christmas, I will also include a container of Bird's custard powder to special relatives and friends so they can learn how easy it is to make excellent trifle with this product. For my non-English family and friends, I will include laminated instructions based on my own successes with Bird's custard recipe for trifle. English trifle is so easy to make with the following:  Bird's custard powder, store-bought pound cake, thawed frozen fruit, some sherry wine (or slightly sweetened juice from the thawed frozen fruit) poured over the small slices of cake. For the final touch, add non-dairy whipped ""creme."" Delicious and inexpensive! I highly recommend this product and am so pleased to be able to purchase it through Amazon.

B003O7A70Y,Shai,Makes excellent biryani,"I actually use this mix to make vegetable biryani and it works well for this purpose,  with some slight adjustments to the recipe. I do have one caveat about the product, but it's about the recipe given, not the spice mix. I think the amount of ghee it is suggested you use (200 grams) is too much, and you can easily use 100 grams instead. Also, I think it's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying. To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee. Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani I've had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them. And the price makes this an incredible deal--there are 2 bags per package and there are 6 packages, so this makes 12 large batches for ~$13 with free shipping. I will definitely order more when I run out.",

The bite-size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.

My female also loves this but she's a little less silly.  Also, this has never upset their stomachs nor caused allergic reactions.  I finally had to find a place that sold this in bulk (i.e., 5 lbs. bags) since I was going to the store ALL the time to buy more of these.  I also stuff their Kongs with a combo of these and their regular kibble and some pumpkin and freeze it. I highly recommend this treat.",

The yellow pasta are flavored with turmeric, the orange with carrot powder. A rainbow of beauty and natural delectable flavor. The pasta are shaped like little cresent moons with a rough exterior to absorb whatever sauce or oil you might use. Because this pasta is so very flavorful, I enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some Celtic sea salt. Sometimes I add some tarragon or fresh rosemary, usually not, so I can just savor the pasta alone. It also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated Parmesan chees on top. With only 1g of fat, 10g of sodium, this can also be a heart-healthy meal. There are 7g of protein and 42g of carbos, no added sugars or preservatives.

Add some crushed garlic, sauteed onions and vegetables of your choice, then mix it all with this sauce and whatever meat you choose (I prefer using the resulting marinade by adding some fresh rosemary and lamb) for two days.

B003MCEV0I,Winter Green,One of the best sweet hot sauces out there,"It's not a traditional BBQ sauce in terms of flavor, but you could easily use it for that. It's very thick and has a strong hotness (not too hot - but hotter than most spicy BBQ sauce) and it's made from much better ingredients than most BBQ or sweet hot sauces. It tastes very fruity rather than sugary sweet. It would be great on almost anything grilled or stir fried, and it's incredible in pork and beans. Don't let the price scare you away from this outstanding condiment.",

B004EKO2HE,emc,"Warning: Reviews do not reflect actual product (Feb 19, 2012)","The current product, ""Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador, sold by SAAQIN"", is of terrible quality. Somehow, reviews for a similar item, produced by ""Alive and Aware"", were associated with this product. The cocoa I received when ordering through this page is made by ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Alive and Aware is delicious; Organic Herbal Essence is not. Another warning: After receiving the 5lb bag of Organic Herbal Essence and hating it, I ordered ""Alive and Aware Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador - 2 Pounds"", shipped by Halaleveryday. I thought for sure I'd get Alive and Aware, given it's in the product title, but Halaleveryday actually shipped me ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Grr.",
B004EKO2HE,k.dietz,Awesome cacao,I have tried a couple of different cocao powders but this one is a step above the other ones.  The richness of the bean has a dark smooth flavor within the powder.  It is just a better product,
B004EKO2HE,Marcia Bicknell,The Price is Right,"I use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks.  With the high price of cocoa on the commodity market, this is an excellent price, especially for an organic product.  The cocoa is less ""tasty"" than my regular brand, but does very well for the price.  My main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with NO label.  I would like to see an organic label, as well as, the nutrition info for the product.",
B004EKO2HE,EB MamaBear,"NOT what I originally ordered! BOO, amazon!","As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.  I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?  Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.  I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.  Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon. For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!) I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back. Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!  I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)  My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!  Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.  Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!",
B004EKO2HE,Pooja Dagli,great tasting cocoa powder,"This cocoa powder has a deep, fruity taste- I highly recommend it.  I recently bought a vitamix blender, which means that I now make 5 smoothies a day.

B004EKO2HE,LS in RI,Alive and Aware Organic Raw Cacao Powder,This was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and I was pleasantly surprised!  The item was packed and shipped professionally and I love the resealable bag.  I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didn't taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable/fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas   I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals you'll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if you're looking to purchase it.,
B004EKO2HE,PhaTz,"Equidorian OJio Arriba Carillo ""RAW Oranic"" Cacao","Raw Cacao Powder differs greatly in taste than processed Cacao Powder. Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough. Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens.",
B004EKO2HE,GC,Poor quality product,"This product, described as organic raw cacao powder from Peru, is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder I have had.  The taste of this product is definitely not as good -- this product has a bitter, muddy, thin taste as compared to the fuller, richer taste of the real thing from other vendors.  As soon as I tasted this product, which is destined for the trash bag, I understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors -- it is nowhere near as good.  Spend a few dollars more and get the real thing.",

B00068PCTU,George Garber,White Stevia 12 Oz Pwdr,Great product! The Stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural. Use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar. Tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener.,
B00068PCTU,"Susan Schenck ""award-winning author of two books""","Great taste, safe & Natural","I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet. My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either. Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.) Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!",
B00068PCTU,Joel Grant,"Only 6.4% Stevia Extract, but very good flavor","I have mixed feelings about NuNaturals Nustevia White Stevia with Maltodextrin Powder and will probably not purchase it again.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  In other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  In my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  If the labeling said 6.4% stevia extract, I would have passed on this from the beginning as I can get 70% dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. If this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as it's easy to use and tastes great.  If you're accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product's mixture. Pros:  - 5-star taste  - Easy to measure  - Perfect for first-time stevia users  - 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar Cons  - Only 6.4% stevia  - Not cost-competitive with 70% or pure dry stevia extracts  - 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar Overall, a good product but not the best value.  I would given it 4 stars if the product labeling didn't try to hide the fact that it's just not very potent.  For about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low-cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead (or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia). In case you're wondering where I got the 6.4% (by mass) value from, this is how I calculated it.  On a precise scale, I found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  The label says it contains 40mg per 1/4 tsp.  Thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  The concentration (mass) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.  Pretty weak stuff, but still much sweeter than cane sugar.",
B00068PCTU,"John ""John""",My new favorite sweetener,"I used to use agave nectar and honey. Even though I picked organic, there was still more sugar than desired after I put in my recipes. I actually got Tinea Versicolor due to the sugars in those products. But this product is great. I use it in my protein shakes, smoothies, and baking recipes (muffins, breads), and it's awesome. I make a chocolate milkshake and this stuff really rounds off the edges:  - Cottage Cheese  - Chocolate Protein Powder  - Cacao powder  - Almond Milk  - Nustevia powder Just need maybe 1/4 cup of each ingredient and 1 cup of almond milk and it takes just like a sugary chocolate milk shake.",
B00068PCTU,Crystal,best tasting stevia,This is the best tasting stevia powder I've tried. Most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesn't. I recently bought a 5lb bag of it online and I'm making my way through it.,

We went to stevia no calorie powder, after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects. The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste. I also found that using a stevia that has an 80% ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that I have found. Because of using VERY SMALL amounts this jar lasts for months. This is also the best price ANYWHERE! Swanson is a trusted vendor as is Amazon.",
B00068PCTU,AJ Andersen,An Excellent Alternative to Artificial Sweetners,"I am hooked on Stevia. Not only is it all natural but it tastes great and is truly a guilt free sweetner. Of all the brands I have tried NuNaturals is the best; it dissolves easily in ice tea and it does not have any bitter taste. I keep the packets in my car and my backpack for when I eat out, I use the stevia baking blend to replace sugar in all my muffins and cookies, and this is large 12 oz jar the best size for use at home. I keep a 1/4 tsp measuring spoon in the jar to spoon it out. I have given up all artificial sweetners. I no longer drink diet coke (and wont until they make it with stevia instead of splenda). If you have not used stevia before I urge you to try it. If you have used other brands and did not like them try NuStevia and you will be impressed.",
B00068PCTU,"Suzanne ""Suzanne""",Best tasting,This has been the best tasting Stevia I have tried.  I also think this is a better value than some of the others.  I really like not having to open all the packets when I make a gallon of Tea.,
B00068PCTU,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""",Also look for the packets,"If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder. Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods. By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it. ~The Rebecca Review",

B00068PCTU,"C. Mahon ""hippie chick""",I love this stuff,"I don't like using artificial sweeteners because of the chemicals and because they don't taste good. I am a caregiver for my diabetic dad, and once I discovered this product I was hooked, except that it is hard to find where I live. When I found it at Amazon I put it on auto ship so I don't run out.  The price has gone up a lot since I first found it on Amazon, however, it still costs more in stores if and when I can find it there. I make limeade with this which I keep on hand at all times. In a gallon container of water I add 1 cup of lime juice and 2tbsp. of stevia powder. It is refreshing and almost no calories and no chemical aftertaste.  My dad uses the stevia in his coffee and his oatmeal. I haven't tried cooking with it although I know they make one designed for baking, which I'll possibly try this winter.",
B00068PCTU,a reader,Tastes great in iced drinks,"I bought the NuNaturals White Stevia with Maltodextrin several months ago as I'm trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners. The first morning I tried it in my coffee and hated it. It tastes just as bitter as Equal or Sweet n Low. I decided to give it another  try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious. I've also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea. So, I think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia. All in all I'm glad I bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go. I have tried many different brands of stevia but, so far this is the only one I have not thrown out. I also tried Truvia. Not a fan. It makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice!",

B00068PCTU,Happy Theologian,Great Taste and Zero Calories,"I have tried various brands of stevia, but I always come back to NuNaturals.  I buy the 12 ounce container because I use it to sweeten everything.  If you have a sweet tooth as I do but don't need the added pounds, then this is the ticket for you.  I drink a lot of tea, and this is my sweetener.  A lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste, but this is the best that I have found to resolve that problem.  Highly recommended.",

Nustevia has absolutely NO bitterness, and tastes EXACTLY like real sugar!  It's amazing!  Add it to plain yogurt, you have an amazing guilt-free dessert, breakfast, side dish, snack.  Add it to tea, coffee, recipes, anything!  It is a truly magical product, and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on Amazon than anywhere else!  They also sell it at GNC, but it is $10 for 4 oz.  Also, for drinks, I highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia, as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages (it eventually does dissolve, though).",
B00068PCTU,tropical lady,Best stevia product I've found,"After years of using synthetic sweeteners like Equal and Sweet N Low, I realized their long-term effects and wanted to find a good alternative. NuStevia was a lucky discovery. It has virtually no bitter aftertase, it's all natural and I've been using it exclusively for more than a year now. It works in both hot and cold beverages and comes in bulk and in packets for portability.I haven't used it for baking and probably won't because the chemistry of most recipes depends on sugar or something similar to get a good effect. However, for daily use in beverages, this product is very good.",
B00068PCTU,ASH,Sweet stuff!,"I was quite skeptical about stevia at first, but tried it with another brand and thought there wasn't much difference in taste and I felt better about using a more natural product than the other artificial sweeteners out there. I then started looking at getting a bulk container and happened upon this product. I now have purchased this same product 4 times and am quite pleased. The product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitors. The deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging.",
B00068PCTU,ddroses,great product,"We love this and use it as a sugar substitute in just about everything (beverages, desserts, cooking). It is not at all bitter, even in hot drinks like coffee. For baking, there are good substitution charts online that tell you how much stevia to use per cup of sugar ([ ]). If you need to replace the ""bulk"" of sugar in a recipe, you also have to add homemade apple fiber to make it work ([ ]). My kids don't notice the switch and I feel good about using it because it's all natural.",

I only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores. There is a soda that has stevia in it that I purchase at a health food store called Virgil's Zero and it comes in different flavors it is great and I don't have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas.

Where I moved to in NY I could not find it in the stores so I looked online. With shipping costs, it still cost under 20 dollars. I use this product in tea and coffee and I like it better than real sugar. I don't find it bitter at all even when I accidently put a little too much in ice tea. Sometimes I forget it's not real sugar when it's in ice tea. I especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste.

I love sweet things, and without them I don't think I'd have been able to stay on the low-carb diet.  I have been unable to eat sugar for a long, long while.  I had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave, but when I discovered they were not on the low-carb diet I'd switched to, I had to find something else to use as a substitute.  NuStevia products are what I chose.  I tried several other types of stevia, but NuStevia products seem to be the best so far.  The bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from NuStevia products.  NuStevia white stevia powder is super sweet, so you'll have to use it sparingly, and one bottle lasts a very long time.  I'm very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again.",

Since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and I have a sweet tooth, I felt this was a safe alternative. Not only is it safer, but there's no aftertaste and doesn't raise your blood sugar level. This particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it. I've tried others before and since and there's no comparison.",

Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad.",

B005K4Q1VI,Monica E,Creamy & Rich Cocoa,"I was hesitant to try this cocoa after all the horrible reviews about how it tasted so bad, and had a really bad Sucralose flavor. I don't know if I'm just not as picky as others or what it is, but I thought this hot cocoa was really good. Creamy and rich, and almost TOO sweet. I don't think it has an ""aftertaste"" though, how some have described. I used the middle water setting on my Keurig or ""small mug"" 7.25 oz., I guess. Everyone has their own tastes and preferences, but as for me, I really like this product!",
B005K4Q1VI,Miss Gamble,best k-cup hot chocolate,"This is hands down the best tasting k-cup hot chocolate available.  The Cafe Escapes or whatever the brand name is tastes very watered down and artificial, while this one tastes thicker and milkier.  I love the dark chocolate flavor, although if I didn't know it wasn't dark I probably couldn't have told the difference between it and a regular cup of cocoa.  I will stick with the flavor just because it will probably be richer than the milk chocolate option.  These are such a hit at my house when the weather is cool.  Everyone always wants hot chocolate! Something to note on this is that these work much better when used with about 6 oz per k-cup.  I use 2 k-cups per mug and the flavor is much better than when I try one (too watery).",

She likes the convenience of the product in the Keurig Coffee Maker. The chocolate does not stick to the sides of the cup like the cheap hot chocolate in the paper bags. Overall it tastes pretty good. It is a little weak but good. Use only on the small cup setting in the Keurig. 4 stars.,
B005K4Q1VI,Donna,Really good!,"I bought this because it was a very good price.  It was really good though.  I love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoa. Will keep buying this until they don't sell it anymore. It is really creamy.  I like it best with 6 ounces of water, gives it a thicker feel.",
B005K4Q1VI,Mary E Teague,Received expired product,"I was disappointed by the fact that all three boxes I received had already expired.  Luckily enough, the flavors had not yet degraded.

The peppermint hot chocolate does not have much peppermint flavor to it, but we will still enjoy it and both of the other flavors.",

I would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again.",
B005K4Q1VI,Eric Stein,Sugar AND Sucralose,I didn't read the reviews thoroughly and found out too late that this product has enough sugar to give it 60 calories and 11 grams of carbohydrate in each cup.

I'd like to see amazon include nutritional info in the future.,

B005K4Q1VI,suaimhneas15,Too watery after multiple settings.,"A hot chocolate packet was the first K-Cup on my new Keurig (it was 1 a.m. and I wasn't ready for coffee before bed). I had read they ran a little watery but I decided to try it on the 10 oz. setting, took a sip, and tossed it. The next morning I made one with 8 oz. and added some whipped cream. The taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery. My husband made one to try at 6 oz. and said it tasted like sugar water. I might try combining 2-3 6 oz. servings to use the box up but we won't be buying more.",

The kids love it - they especially like the peppermint flavor which I can't see any other way to get except in this mixed box.  You get milk chocolate, dark chocolate and peppermint flavors.  I tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste.  I make it on the lowest setting on my Keurig which I think is around 7 ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them.  If you like a strong chocolate flavor this isn't it.",
B005K4Q1VI,kathyallen45,Hot Choc K Cup,Wow what a deal. These taste just as good as the expensive brands. Most definately will be buying these again.,
B005K4Q1VI,"J. Newman ""J. Newman""","Better than the others, but still not quite there","I feel like I've tried every hot cocoa there is in the k-cups.  While I do think this is the best hot cocoa so far, it still isn't great.  I'm not sure what it is, but all of the cocoa k-cups seem to have a weird taste to them.  It's almost like there is artificial sweetener in them,, but I know there is not.  I set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa.  This has more body to it than others.  I'm still waiting and hoping that Dunkin' Donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k-cup.  There really is nothing better than that.  If you want a k-cup hot cocoa, I would def. recommend this over all the others.",
B005K4Q1VI,Raven A. Wind,Why can't anyone make a hot cocoa without sucralose/Splenda in it?,"I HATE SUCRALOSE. Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising. That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition. Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run). There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find. My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me. So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option. Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere. UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing. UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets. I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself. So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant. 43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon.",
B005K4Q1VI,"C. F. Hill ""CFH""",Really Good Hot Cocoa - Highly Recommended,"These Grove Square Hot Cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the Keurig. We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good. Dark Chocolate - My favorite, very good even on the ""large"" cup setting  Milk Chocolate - Excellent on the ""small"" cup and good on the ""large"" cup setting  Peppermint - Everyone likes this one, on either cup size setting These do contain Sucralose in addition to sugar, I don't notice the taste but my wife does (but she still likes them). Highly Recommended! CFH",
B005K4Q1VI,lynnsmom,Great flavor!,Excellent product! A tip from the Keurig people: shake the K-cup before using it. This prevents the cocoa from clumping and results in more flavor.,
B005K4Q1VI,Rob,Not bad. Not bad at all.,"I have read some really funny reviews about this product.  Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars. But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too. I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  I've dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.  I'll buy it again!",
B005K4Q1VI,Book Vamp,Perfect Cocoa,"Everyone in my family likes hot cocoa. I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. So I decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. No overflow. The taste is good, its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids. I will be ordering this product from now on for my family.  In the interest of product comparison, we have ordered Timothy's white hot chocolate, and Green Mountain Hot cocoa, Timothy's was great, but pricy, and Green Mountain didn't really taste all that great to our family. It had a watered down taste to it.",
B005K4Q1VI,J. Moore,Tasty and at a great price.,"When I weigh the convenience of a K cup against the price and the taste, I would characterize these as a winner. Not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet, these are pretty darn good. They nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that I've had with some other brands. Do not select 10 oz on your machine though. Make it only at 6 or 8 oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion. All in all a fine cup of hot chocolate.",
B005K4Q1VI,ShanyaG.,"Much better than expected, great for the kids","I am actually surprised at how good this product is. I am a Cuisinart Keurig owner with two teens that love to drink hot cocoa and cider pretty much year round. Price point: The price for these at the store ( exact brand ) is almost triple of what we pay here for the same amount, with subscribe and save this makes these quite affordable for my family use. In comparison to other more expensive brands it's a great bargain without sacrificing quality over quantity. Flavor wise: My kids love it, and have already asked me to purchase more. My daughter says that the peppermint is right on and not too weak even if using a larger cup. I love the dark chocolate in my coffee to make a mocha ( 10oz coffee to 4 oz chocolate ) and it's much better than some other brands that I have tried in the past. Overall impression:  Great value, good flavor, excellent price point I will be purchasing more.",
B005K4Q1VI,"W. Hoyt ""Pee Wee Shooter""","Rich, thick cocoa.  Surprisingly good!","Ordered on a whim.  My first ""Grove Square"" purchase.  Great for the family's occasional cocoa desire.  Being a K-Cup it's fast and easy.  Was a little worried the cocoa might leave some after taste in my coffee, so far so good.  Great cup of dark, rich cocoa.  Maybe could taste a LITTLE better if it was from a gourmet brand you mix yourself with steamed milk.  The ease and simplicity, and lack of clean up, make this a better option for me.  Will order again.  Nice to see it on subscribe and save.",

B005K4Q1VI,Hal DeVore,Sucralose!,"I really, really dislike Sucralose.  I don't like the taste, the aftertaste, or the after effects.  I bought this based on it NOT saying it was ""diet"" or ""low calorie"".  The first ingredient is Sugar so it's only partially sweetened with Sucralose.

B005K4Q1VI,"Kay Hayes ""knitting ninja""","Not bad, not bad at all","I really like hot cocoa!  I like it sooo much that I have a Cocoa Latte machine, which is great, but sometimes I just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher.  When that happens I used to put on the kettle and heat up the water, then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir, and stir, and stir.  And after all that stirring, I'd still get little lumps in my cocoa.  With the K-cups, I get smooth rich cocoa with NO lumps and NO clean-up.  Easy and yummy! Please note: THESE ARE NOT SUGAR-FREE.  The very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and I did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients.  Each cup has only 60 calories, but if you want sugar-free or are diabetic then this product is probably not for you.",

It has the richest flavor and I dont notice the artificial taste that others have commented on.  Its also very affordable compared to other k-cups right now.  I thought that the k-cup making process must have gotten more expensive over the last year, but now I know they are truely sticking it to us since these are still reasonable priced.",
B005K4Q1VI,S. Saylor,FAVORITE HOT COCOA!,"This is the absolute best hot cocoa for the Keurig Brewers. All of the other Hot Cocoa's that we have tried we had to ""doctor"" to make them taste good. We had to add more cocoa and more sugar. I was pretty much making my own cocoa, which defeated the purpose of the brewer. But the Grove Square Hot Cocoa does not need any help. In my opinion, It has just the right amount of flavor!!",
B005K4Q1VI,Tammy,Yummy,"Oh so good. The first cup I had was on the medium setting. It was too sweet. So I had my second on the larger setting and it was perfect! This is a creamy hot chocolate. Add a little milk and and whipped cream, and your set!!!!",
B005K4Q1VI,K cup lover,Yummy hot chocolate,"I was quite pleased with e flavor of this product. A good, strong, yet not overpowering flavor.  Rich chocolate flavor. VERY pleasing. I highly recomend this product!",
B005K4Q1VI,"Gloria ""tapp4010""",Pretty good hot chocolate,"I'm giving this product 5 stars because I think it is great considering that it is made with water.  The hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size.  If you want a large cup of hot chocolate, use 2 k-cups.  It is fairly low in calories, most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little k-cup.",
B005K4Q1VI,A. Hardeman,Should have listened to other bad reviews :(,I wish I had listened to the other bad reviews.  The artificial sweetener taste is awful.  I gave two stars only because my husband doesn't seem to mind.  I can't drink this- even if they were a bargain.,
B005K4Q1VI,M. Fell,Good Buy,"Better than expected, but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste. This is a good purchase for the price.",
B005K4Q1VI,Gail in NY,Tastes like a diet product,"I looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa, but was very disappointed with the flavor. It has an awful aftertaste, like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. Also kind of weak, even on the smallest cup setting.",
B005K4Q1VI,Simply Me,Not good!,"So bad, I returned it. My children didn't even like it, and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food.",
B005K4Q1VI,"Jack E. Stoudenmire Jr. ""Ravenous reader""",Chocolate heaven!,"KCups are a godsend; among KCups, these are near the top. The Keurig brewer is a blessing, hot beverages in seconds, mostly coffee; but there are greater and lesses among the coffees, and so, it seems, among the hot cocoas. This is so rich and vibrant, it announces itself from two rooms away.  Silky, smooth, bursting with all the things chocolate is supposed to deliver, it's a must-have in this household.",
B005K4Q1VI,"Gabriela C. Zakak ""Gab""",Awesome!,"This is the best hot cocoa I have tried for the Keurig . Rich, chocolate flavor (I used the 6oz setting) and it is not watery.  If you like hot cocoa, and the convenience of a K-cup, this is the one to get!",

I've tasted several and this by far is the better one, but I have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.  Will definitely purchase more, but at the rate my family downs these, we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective.",
B005K4Q1VI,Tamara Hook,hot cocoa,I ordered this as a christmas present for my Daughter and Son in law. He tried it the day after Christmas and gave it 2 thumbs up.,
B005K4Q1VI,S. Haas,Very good Hot Chocolate,"I bought a box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa because I love their Cappuccino French Vanilla.  I used the medium cup setting and added some whipped cream it was to die for.  Very yummy and almost as good as homemade.  I never noticed an aftertaste like other reviews, but it could be because of the Redi Whip I added to it.  I highly recommend it.",

I came across this when searching for some good Hot Cocoa and am amazed at how many K-Cups you really get out of this. 48 K-Cups for about $20 when I purchased was a great deal when most Hot Chocolate prices were 16 K-Cups for $15~$19. This is a great deal and you get to try out Peppermint, Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate. It's light on calories and most important of all taste GREAT!

Will order this product again",
B005K4Q1VI,"J. T. Mathews ""Starfuryzeta""",Best tasting cocoa k-cup available,"After trying many of the other hot cocoa k-cup options, I find that the Grove Square product tastes the best.  For my personal taste, I find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste.  Just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat.  However, this is not hot chocolate, which may be a turn off for some tasters.",
B005K4Q1VI,Susanna Rey,Finally a good k cup hot chocolate!,"I have tried a number of k cup hot chocolates and grove square is by far the best yet!  Very nice flavor, doesnt have the nasty artificial sweetener flavor like a lot of the kcup hot chocolates.  very impressed!",

B005K4Q1VI,katyroadpink,So bad I had trouble giving it away!,"I tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before I bought it, but couldn't find anything online. Turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists, and yet, that didn't help the taste at all. It is awful. I had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldn't find any takers. I finally got rid it of it at the Christmas White Elephant gift exchange at work. I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment. Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste. It takes about three minutes, and it's delicious. Now, where did I put those mini-marshmallows?",
B005K4Q1VI,Dale Borja,This hits the spot!,"Sometimes, I'd rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work. This meets my cocoa craving. I do not need to add sugar - just add water and brew!",

B005K4Q1VI,K. Addison,Excellent Hot Chocolate,"Having tried all the varieties of hot chocolate k-cups, Grove Square's are by far the best.  They are very chocolaty, rich, creamy, and leave very little sludge in the bottom of your cup.  Yum ",
B005K4Q1VI,A. MOHR,Best Hot Cocoa Ever,"I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I don't drink coffee and I was searching for more hot chocolates for my Keurig. I am a Milk Chocolate fan, but with Grove Square the Peppermint and Dark Chocolate are by far the better choice.Both have a sweetness I wasn't expecting. The flavor is great and I don't want to share. I am definitely reordering more.",
B005K4Q1VI,Logo,BEST HOT COCOA YET,This is by far the best hot cocoa I have found yet for the Keurig. I love the assortment and the peppermint is my favorite. I would give these try for sure if you are looking for some hot cocoa K-cups. All the other selections for hot cocoa that I have tried were just okay tasting. These are AMAZING!!!! LOVE THEM! I will order these for sure again!,
B005K4Q1VI,Cameron,Horrible Taste!,"I just got a Keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee.  I didn't have super high expectations, but these are absolutely awful.  There is a very strong plastic/chemical taste to these k-cups.  I tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help.  The only reason I gave these k-cups 2 stars is because my boyfriend can ""tolerate"" them, but I don't trust him because he'll eat just about anything.  In his opinion they are ""not that good"" but he will still drink the mug. From what I've read of other hot chocolate k-cups, you'd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way!",

B005K4Q1VI,Beth(bookaholicmom),Great Hot Cocoa!,We had previously tried another brand of hot coca k-cups. We bought these since they seemed to be a pretty good value. We actually like the taste and flavor of these more than the other brand we tried. They have just the right amount of cocoa and sweetness. We like the variety of flavors in the pack also.,
B005K4Q1VI,Melody Nye,great assortment,"I am so glad that this hot chocolate is available for Keurig.  Previously the brand of hot chocolate available was only so-so, but this is definitely better.

Usually I don't justify buying k-cups for things like cocoa that you can get cheaper in a packet, but this is so convenient and very good tasting .. way better than most powdered cocoa packets I've tried.  As far as price comparison, it is equivalent to gourmet-types of cocoa that would easily cost $1+ per packet.  I also like that it comes in a variety pack with 3 flavor options.  Highly recommend",
B005K4Q1VI,RiversRhapsody,Yum!,"I ordered this wanting to try a hot chocolate on my Keurig, and I am very happy with this product. I will definitely be ordering it again. That being said, I dislike hot chocolate made completely of water, so I do add a splash of Half and Half to my cup when I make this. Thus, I didn't want to give it a 5 star rating since I do doctor my cup up a bit at home (otherwise I would have). However, I won't even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water, I use 100% milk usually for those and they still don't measure up to this product from Grove Square. So, the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes. I do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that I have ever tried at home. Compared to the Swiss Miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it. I'm a big fan!",
B005K4Q1VI,Karen Fish,Great Product!,"Great product at a reasonable price .my husband's favorite!

The Dark makes a great mocha, just do half a cup of the Dark Cocoa and half a cup of your favorite coffee, add whipped cream on top, delicious.  Also worth noting, you can try some of the flavored coffees in your Mocha and rustle up some great combos. I am not a fan of flavored coffee, i struggle to drink a cup but as a Mocha, delightful. Drinking the Peppermint or Milk as a hot chocolate, we add a little milk and whipped cream on top, delicious. I highly recommend this variety box if you are considering buying it. :-)",
B005K4Q1VI,"K. Te ""Gadget lover""",You get what you paid for,"Well you get what you paid for. While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho, in fact kinda too sweet for my taste (i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar/sweetener). I thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so I lowered the cup size from 8 ounce to 6 ounce on my Keurig brewer and it's the same thing.",

B005K4Q1VI,Kenneth K. Rivera,Pretty good - not as bad as others are saying.,"Funny thing - I bought some of these K-cups several weeks ago based on the strength of the reviews at that time.  I just got them last week and have had a few cups since then.  I'm using 8 ounces of water to prepare the cocoa.  I thought they tasted pretty good - reasonably chocolaty and smooth. They were sweet, but not overly so, and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box.  60 calories - hey, not too bad!  It wasn't until now that I came back to place a review and I read the most recent reviews from others did I realize they use artificial sweetener.  Honestly, if I hadn't read it I would have never known - I didn't detect anything that gave me the hint when I drank it. I think if you like a quick cocoa on the run you'll be happy enough with these K-cups.  Are they as good as a Swiss Miss packet from Costco?  Maybe not, but in my office I don't want to deal with getting powder on the counters and needing a spoon to get things mixed.  You'll sacrifice a little for the convenience, but to me it's well worth it.",
B005K4Q1VI,09GalantDriver,Mixed Reviews,"Unfortunately, I am conflicted with my purchase. Although the final product was quite good, 4 stars. The quality of the delivery is why they lost an additional star. I opened the Amazon box to find that there was hot chocolate powder coming out of the Grove Square packaging. I opened it to find that 2 of the K-Cups weren't sealed properly on top and were spilling into the box. I inspected both the Amazon package and the Grove Square both of which had no visible exterior damage. I was disappointed with both Grove Square for the quality of their product and as a result I am not sure I would buy this product again.",

B005K4Q1VI,fierydream,Much better and less expensive than that ordered from Keurig!,"I recently purchased a Keurig and I bought the Cafe Escapes dark chocolate cocoa from their site, and it was not chocolately and had a strange aftertaste.  I saw the Grove Square brand and thought I would give it a try since I got 36 kcups for less than the 24 from Keurig. I received my purchase yesterday and immediately opened it up to try it.  The cocoa actually has sugar in it and the chocolately flavor is much better than the Cafe Escapes. I will be ordering this one again, and I hope my guest will drink the other kind to get rid of it!",
B005K4Q1VI,"Kevin Nicholls ""jaded, aging hipster""",At least it wasn't expensive.,"With <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00389Q4XW"">Green Mountain Hot Cocoa</a> being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot. Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first ""unofficial"" producers of ""we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker"" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price. Well  I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be. As others have pointed out, there's a definite ""diet"" or ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK"">Splenda</a>"" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure. ""Well  it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners. The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds. The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone  er  please my discerning guests  with a few cups. If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this.",
B005K4Q1VI,T. Kirkpatrick,Surprisingly Good!,"We have tried many of the different hot cocoa k-cups everything always tasted so watered down, even when using the smallest setting on the machine.  However, this brand even at the medium cup setting, tasted fantastic.  I highly recommend Grove Square.

B005K4Q1VI,"T. B. H. ""The Bargain Hunter""","Too sweet, too weak","Using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak. It was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup. Using 6 oz made the cocoa much too sweet, and still too weak in the chocolate department. It uses sucralose as a sweetener, which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor. This may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or don't mind the taste of sucralose. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people.",
B005K4Q1VI,B. Meyers,Best Hot Cocoa for Keurig,"Perhaps not your Grandma's cup of Hot Chocolate, but for the Keurig, it's the best out there.  And what makes it a sweeter deal you get 3 packs for the typical price of 1 K-Cup box, take note it's a Pack of 3, so a total of 36 k-cups. I suggest only using the small cup setting to prevent it from being watered down too much, but decide for yourself!",

I have to say, that I was pleasantly surprised at how good this is.  My favorite is the dark chocolate, but the peppermint is very good as well.  I am not a real milk chocolate fan, but I mixed it with some coffee for a mocha and it was very good. I would definitely purchase this again.",
B005K4Q1VI,moycegirl,Best Hot Cocoa for Keurig,As you know finding a hot chocolate that taste great and is brewed on the keurig is a big challenge. Well this hot chocolate is quite good. The flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it. I made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it.  Will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder.,
B005K4Q1VI,Math Girl,not perfect but better than the rest,"although this isn't a perfect cup of cocoa, it's far superior to the others that i have tried. i will order this again.",
B005K4Q1VI,SEB,Excellent hot cocoa!!!,"This is by far the best K-cup hot cocoa we have tried.  It has a nice rich flavor and with the added convenience of a K-cup, it is easy to have a cup anytime you like. Highly recommend!",
B005K4Q1VI,sxbaughsx3,Fantastic,"Out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that I have tried this is by far the best one. Not weird aftertaste, and not watered down. Tastes amazing and priced fairly, what more could you ask for?",
B005K4Q1VI,"Sue ""ausuep""",Delicious!,These k-cups are just what my son wanted!  The price was excellent and the flavor is rich.  I would recommend these to anyone wanting a good cup of instant hot cocoa.,
B005K4Q1VI,N. Greco,Great cocoa,I am a big hot cocoa drinker so this hot cocoa I would definitely recommend it has a great cocoa flavor and it's perfect for those cold fall or winter days. Warms you up plus tastes great!,
B005K4Q1VI,"Kimberly I. ""Shopaholic""",Contains Trans-Fats,"Can't tell you how this tastes, because I read the ingredients first, but it has trans-fats in every flavor. :( The seller should disclose all ingredients in the description. I wouldn't have purchased this otherwise.",
B005K4Q1VI,TDP,Very disapointing!!,"I received my order of Grove Square hot cocoa mix today, and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix. I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels. I would urge Amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale. If the ingredients had been listed, those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products.",
B005K4Q1VI,BenB,Dark chocolate lover - best I've tried,"I mainly use my Keurig for coffee but thought I'd try this one since I love dark chocolate and it was getting mostly good reviews.  I've tried some other chocolate K-cups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery.  If I can taste water I don't consider it real hot chocolate.  I was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others I've tried.  (I must admit there are many I haven't tried, but I don't really feel like making a big scientific study of it.)  This will be my source of hot chocolate from now on. I was a little disappointed to see how many ingredients it contains.  That sort of thing worries me a little.  Still, I don't drink hot chocolate that much, so I think I'll survive.  I'll copy the ingredient label here for those concerned plus a few items from the nutrition info: Calories 60, from fat 20.  Trans Fat 0g. Sodium 200mg. Sugars 6g. INGREDIENTS: sugar, glucose syrup solids, cocoa (processed with alkali), partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (may contain coconut, soybean, sunflower, palm and/or canola), modified whey, maltodextrin, salt, natural and artificial flavors, cellulose gum, sodium caseinate, cornstarch, lactose, dipotassium phosphate, sucralose, mono- and diglycerides, silicon dioxide, soy lecithin, artificial color. [Contains milk and soy.] (I always hate seeing artificial coloring in ""dark"" chocolate products.) If I had hot chocolate every day I would consider making it from scratch with more cocoa and fewer chemicals, but since I enjoy the convenience of having it nearly instantly from my Keurig on the occasional whim, I'll just keep a box of these K-cups on hand.  I highly recommend it for the taste, it isn't easy finding good hot chocolate.",
B005K4Q1VI,Elizabeth Ramsoram,Not good,This does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use.I is just not good.,
B005K4Q1VI,"T. torrez ""Kat""","Not bad, but not good either","When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled. So I guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes.",
B005K4Q1VI,Always Shopping,Bad Taste,"I ordered this product because of a good price deal.  Amazon shipped accordingly, absolutely no problems there.  However, the taste of this product was horrendous.  It tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it.  I personally will go back to buying Swiss Miss in a can and just using the Keurig to give me Hot Water, cheaper and much better tasting.",
B005K4Q1VI,J. Voss,Worst Hot chocolate ever!,"This has to be without a doubt the WORST tasting Hot Chocolate ever! The best way to describe the taste of ""This Stuff"" is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. Swiss Miss instant is way better and cost less. After only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this ""SLOP""!",
B005K4Q1VI,Allison H.,It's decent ,"This is okay cocoa. It's not really very smooth, and it's a little watery. I had high hopes, as I love dark chocolate hot cocoa, and the reviews were good. I will finish the box I bought, but will try another brand next time.",

B005K4Q1VI,Userva3,Great as a creamer or added chocolate flavoring,I haven't actually tried drinking these just as hot cocoa but I know the peppermint flavor is great as a creamer for the Van Houtte Mexican coffee I'm ordering another box as this adds just the right amount of chocolate to my coffee.  Been trying to find a coffee flavor that does that but so far adding these to the coffee has worked out better :-) I usually have 14 oz at a time so I run 4 oz through as hot chocolate and the other 10 as coffee. I did try another brand of kcup hot cocoa and it wasn't as good as this brand.,
B005K4Q1VI,L. Ketchum,"The ""Replicator"" of our time.","We have a new hot beverage cooker. This thing is the closest thing to the futuristic ""replicators"", made know via Star Trek movies and series of various efforts. We love our hot beverage brewer and have added a higher-end unit to our own home environment. We've used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years, but this kit tops that experience. I especially like the Hot-Chocolate and Tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee options. Do consider buying one of their devices and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees, teas and other hot beverages attached to the brewing station.",
B005K4Q1VI,Greg,Delicious,"I'd never heard of this brand but they were very cheap here on Amazon and I was extremely surprised at how good the Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa is.  Absolutely worth trying, it's really quite good.",
B005K4Q1VI,B. Webb,It's Ok. Best I Have Found So Far,"This is the best Hot Cocoa I have found so far, BUT I hope I can find better. It's not real chocolately. Wish it were a bit sweeter but on the whole, I would buy it again if I can't find better.",
B005K4Q1VI,Amberley's mom,Great Hot Chocolate,This is really great Hot chocolate. The price is right too. Usually I find that hot chocolate k-cups are weak or watery but not this one. I was impressed. The dark chocolate is really yummy! I will be ordering more.,
B005K4Q1VI,K. Maffei,"Why, oh why, add fake sugar?","Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k-cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information! I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste. Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.) It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.) If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products.",

Not only was the hot chocolate watery, but it had a horrible plastic aftertaste also. Yuck!",
B005K4Q1VI,Nikki,Taste like diet,"I ordered this specifically b/c they said ""dark chocolate"" so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor. They taste very watery, even using the lowest amount of water on the Keurig. The nutritional fact show that it only has 6 grams of sugar - where the normal store bought powder has 22 grams. I didn't like these at all. If you're going for something low sugar, they might be for you!",
B005K4Q1VI,Twoblueeyesmn,Not Good,"I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct ""plasticy"" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way.",
B005K4Q1VI,Stephen,SoSo,This hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products.  We tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we'll be going back to the cafe escapes brand.,

B005K4Q1VI,D. Janz,Very acceptable K Cup Hot Chocolate,"Unlike some others, this is actually IN a K Cup and not just an overpriced version of Swiss Miss.  While the flavor is not super premium like a Godiva or Ghiradhelli, it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak K Cup versions I've had.  The sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix, but it isn't unpleasant. I like to brew this on the smallest setting (4oz) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave, I think that gives a richer taste. The peppermint is my favorite, followed by the dark and then the light chocolate.  They are all very good.  My only wish is that I could buy the peppermint on its own and not in a combo pack only.",
B005K4Q1VI,Dragon_Lady,Pretty good,"These are the only kind of cocoa k-cups I have tried, as I have a fairly new machine. My only complaint is that it seems like the taste of chocolate in the milk chocolate version needs a bit of a boost. However, I usually add another teaspoon of regular cocoa mix and the taste is great. The peppermint and dark chocolate k-cups are delicious. Definitely worth a shot for this great price!",
B005K4Q1VI,JustMe,Good Stuff,"Whole family liked all three flavors.  We've had some of the other brands of hot chocolates and they were good also but just couldn't get myself to pay that much  for hot  chocolate.  The  price was right on these for sure but I was skeptical after reading reviews on the coffees made by this brand.  But it's just hot chocolate so I figured what the heck.  All three are actually plenty chocolaty on the biggest size serving.  Honestly, I think they're a little bit better than the other brands we've had.",
B005K4Q1VI,James C. Boland,nice flavor,What I really like about this selection is the choice of three different hot cocoa chocolates.

So I decided that even with some bad reviews I'd try this one since it has a lot of good reviews.  I'm just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread.  Some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute, or some such thing.  All I can tell you is I must have under-achieving taste buds because all I can taste is yummy hot chocolate.  My family burned through the first box and I just ordered two more.  If you don't like this I feel sorry for you. Better to have numb taste buds I guess.  Enjoy.",

Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas). One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some.",

I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again . I would not recommend these to anyone.",
B005K4Q1VI,Shannon D. Pinder,It's not the greatest,"I'm an avid hot chocolate drinker, and this is just doesn't measure up.  It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.  No matter what size you set your cup on, it's just missing that cocoa flavor.  Maybe the dark chocolate would be better.  I personally like the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate better! I bought a 24 pack, and then I was able to find it at my local grocery store, so I bought another one.  Now, I'm stuck with the 24 pack.",
B005K4Q1VI,Elizabeth Crasten,Grove Square Hot Cocoa cups,This is a very mild hot cocoa.  Perfect for those winter evenings or even good in the morning instead of coffee.  We love it anytime.  Next time I will try the dark chocolate.,

I wish the peppermint was available on its own, not in the variety pack.  My son and I also like to add peppermint flavored marshmallows, for an extra shot of peppermint taste.  In my opinion, better than the Swiss Miss K-cups.",
B005K4Q1VI,Ameri_star,Nice tasting cocoa,"The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasn't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint  what can I say? That's what it's supposed to taste like.",
B005K4Q1VI,dopey62,Love it!,"We enjoy a cup of hot chocolate with our Keurig machine and used to have Cafe Escapes as our favorite.  When I saw the Grove Square brand at such a great price, I thought I'd give it a try.  We love it - it is now our favorite brand.  I will be back for more!",

B005K4Q1VI,Jenna Moore,"Good taste, bad product","I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.",

Obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many 1 and 5 star ratings for the exact same product?

This is my go to tea when I want something with a little more flavor than ""regular"" black tea. I don't sweeten my tea, but I think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day. The orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others. It's noticeable without being pungent or artificial. It also isn't spiced like many other orange teas.",

B005ZHJI9C,Smeggy,Yum!,"This soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours. Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :) One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.)

As someone with many food sensitivities who also avoids sugar, this is the perfect treat for me when I crave chocolate or baked goods.  The raw nuts are crisp and fresh tasting.  However, the price was very high for the quantity of product.  With less than 20 brazil nuts in the package, I felt a little gipped.  In future, I'll try making my own chocolate nut mix from bulk raw nuts, berries, and coco powder rather than spend $9 per package!  For that price, I'd like a lot more product.",

And being heirloom, I believe you can also save some back to plant, if you have the climate for growing them.  (Unfortunately, I don't.) Out of all the ones I've tried, we like the Borlotti best - they cook up plump and will hold their shape, with a creamy interior.  They're fantastic for Mexican-style beans - frijoles borrachos, refried, whatever you like.  And I've also cooked them with ham hocks/garlic/onions etc. for a delightful bowl of beans. This particular assortment doesn't have the Borlotti beans but you could always add them to your order!  It's a nice sampler and will get you hooked on their products.

B0044UT0O4,L. M. Fuke,"Tantalizing flavor, but scattered distribution","I first encountered this flavor at an airport magazine stand.  I sampled a couple and was hooked.  I thought this flavor was the best of all in the TicTac line.  On my flight, I was munching on the pack absent-mindedly.  I landed with the idea of buying several packs.  Then came the rude surprise - Grapefruit flavor is not a common sight on TicTac stands - anywhere. I finally settled on this purchase as the only way to maintain a steady supply.  This flavor of TicTac is best used as a ""chaser"", following a heavy-duty breath freshening from TicTac Power Mint, the blue color.  Not only is Power Mint effective, it also numbs out my tongue for several minutes.  A follow-up with a single Grapefruit restores my mouth to normality. I rate Grapefruit as the best flavor, with Watermelon and the new Strawberry Foelds close seconds.  In general any flavor TicTac is effective breath-freshening, but Grapefruit is truly addicting.  TicTac settles the issue that the tongue is a major contributor to sour breath.",

B000PWMHW2,brown,One of my most favorite places on earth,"I love The Meadow.  So I guess this review is more about how much I adore this store, than it is about the salt (which by the way is fabulous).  I got my order way faster than I expected, which was nice.  I would recommend purchasing anything from these amazing folks, and even better if you can visit their lovely store in Portland.  This is one of the most romantic stores that exists.  Opening my box of truffle salt, and smelling that fragrant scent, was just not as magical as walking into their gorgeous store filled with flowers, salt, chocolate and wine.  Ah, it is a taste of heaven. The salt's great.  thanks Meadow people.",

The box was opened the day after new years.  The cholocates were discolored and dry.  The box had expired two months before I made the order.  I made a complaint with Amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card.  This company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper.

These were the first and they were bigger and yes, even softer than these are now.  But, at that time, they were the ONLY soft, prepackaged cookie (can you believe that?) besides Archway.  They then came out with at least a dozen other varieties but for some reason, they stopped making them.  I can remember every kid imaginable going nuts over these things so I'm wondering why they stopped. Anyway, back to today, these cookies, even though they're smaller, are still quite excellent.  They are just so soft and taste better than Keebler's other soft and chewy cookies.  This package made it about 20 minutes in this house - that's what happens when you're raising a bunch of Titan boys! Great, great stuff, HIGHLY recommend!",
B004X8TK9W,Jeremy Johnson,Chewy Chips Ahoy vs. Keebler Soft Batch,"Chewy Chips Ahoy and Keebler Soft Batch are very similar taste and texture. I decided to try this since a had a coupon for 50% off. They're slightly smaller than Chips Ahoy, but that's about it. My cookies arrived a little crumbled due to shipping, but no complaints because they were still edible and tasted great. Great Cookies, and now I have a stockpile of them :).",

B006WW3GYC,Sal G.,Jelly Belly's are the Best,"Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!",

The dane has an allergy to chicken and one of the boxers has a weak stomach, so this food is perfect for them.

B001QEF4XC,"Mommared85 ""Cmorlan""",Best Dog Food For the Price!,"It's amazing how little popularity that Diamond Pet Foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain!  I worked at a pet store for about four years. Our number one recommendations on foods were Natural Balance and Wellness- two EXCEPTIONAL foods that are pretty expensive.  But for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog, those brands can cripple your budget.  So when I would get customers who absolutely LOVED their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks, I recommended Diamond.  Diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like Purina and Iams, but contains ONLY natural, healthy ingredients.  Just remember, the less garbage you feed your dog (by-products, fillers) the less your dog uses the bathroom- AND they stay fuller, longer!",
B001QEF4XC,drbearkat,Fantastic dog food - best price - great quality!,"This is the best dog food I have ever purchased, and having been a dog training for over 4 years, I've purchased A LOT! We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food. SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say ""Natural"" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?",

B000HDMW9M,G. G. Meisels,Tasty lunch or snack,"These are better than the usual canned fish filets, tastier, and not dry.  There are no bones or skins.  I worried about Mackerel but they are much nicer than, say, kippered herring filets or sardines in oil.  It's easy to pour off the olive oil if that is a worry, but you'd be losing something that is also tasty.",
B000HDMW9M,Gbupp,Pretty Good,"They taste good and give you a lot for what you pay. The meat was of high quality. I was however expecting each tin to contain one medium sized fillet. Rather, these are about 6 small fillet in a can, much more like sardines are packaged (but these are just fillets). Was a bit disappointing for that, and the info could have been more clear.",

B002LO0TUE,B. E. Simmons,Cute idea,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and his roomates' dogs. It looked really cute in the package but left the dogs exremely gassy. They are a german shepard, pitbull and a retreiver at fairly large sizes but it was a little rough on the tummy so use lightly.",

It's nice and strong, not like crappy Lipton black tea. We've been loyal to the PG brand black tea for over a year now - it's a little pricier than other brands, but definitely worth it if you enjoy black tea.",

B000FDKQC4,"D. Chamberlain ""dchamberlain072002""",A Bitter Pill,"I have to say that I really wanted to like these muffins, but I could not.  They have a really bitter after taste.  Whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product, I do not know.  The Hodgson Mill Blueberry Muffin Mix is a far better choice.  On a positive note, they do raise very nicely, but it is unfortunate that I find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left.",
B000FDKQC4,C. HUMPHREY,Really good muffins!,I baked my first batch of these muffins and was pleased that they were so easy to make and tasted so good.  Then I stored them in the refrigerator since gluten free home baked goods are notorious for molding.  I ate one straight out of the frig and it was great!  I guess the flavors melded together after being stored a few hours.  I finished the batch one at a time out of the frig without re-heating any of them.  They were so good that way I couldn't bring myself to try them any other way.  :) Our family has been navigating the area of gluten free eating for over 10 years.  The choices just keep getting better as more companies are becoming aware of celiac disease.  I have created an astore through Amazon that has the gluten free items we have had the pleasure of trying. [ ],
B000FDKQC4,"T. Jones ""Bargain huntress""",Oh so bitter tasting  ,"I really wanted these to taste good, but there is something in there that is very bitter. I had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable. No one would eat them. They LOOKED delicious after baking and they're healthy, but that's only if you manage to choke one down. I have tried their gingerbread, corn muffin mix, and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great.",
B000FDKQC4,"Cyan ""Lulipop""","Wonderful blend of millet, garbanzo and brown rice flour",If people would read the ingredients they would be less critical of the end product.  I only tried them as pancakes and they lent themselves most excellently. I used an Erythritol instead of sugar and they tated great and cooked very well.  I did not even use a blender to mix.,
B000FDKQC4,"Barbara Stohi ""Barb Stohi""",Not the Best of Hodgson Mill Products,"This item didn't have the pleasant taste that most of Hodgson Mills products have, such as the Wild Blueberry Muffin Mix.  However, I found it greatly improved the flavor & added nutrition if I grated an apple into the mix. It increased the much needed moisture, & it was certainly a nutritious breakfast.",
B000FDKQC4,"Debra A. Buell ""adirondakdeb""",Poor Food Design!!!,"This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products. Try their Blueberry Muffin Mix and hope that one day Amazon will carry a wider array of their Gluten Free offerings as many are very, very good.",
B000FDKQC4,"SherriNAZ ""SherriNAZ""",Not as expected,"These came out smaller than I expected, but the taste as not as good as I thought it should be.  Second time, I added a couple of items, which helped a little, but it is hard to find a great tasting boxed muffin mix.  I thought it would save me time, but I like my own muffins better.  My husband thought they were okay, but not great.",
B000FDKQC4,M. Steinberg,Love these! (for pancakes),"I couldn't get these to work for muffins, so I decided to try the pancakes and wasn't disappointed. They come out perfectly raised every time. I like to make these without any sugar in the batter. The flax makes it very bitter, but I like them like that with lots of butter. However, if you just add some syrup on top, it extinguishes the bitter taste on contact. Give these a try!",
B000FDKQC4,Alyssa,I couldn't stop gagging,"I have never prepared anything so disgusting.  The taste was a mix of sour milk and cardboard, the smell just as bad.  I had to take the trash out because the whole room was beginning to smell.  I bake often, so I know it's not a kitchen error and I'm not that picky, but I could not stop gagging. I would recommend Pamela's brownies--add extra dark chocolate and they're delicious as ""brownie bite"" cookies (side recipe on the bag).  I even make them super healthy and use 1/2C applesause instead of oil!",
B000FDKQC4,LivingOurLoveSong &#60;3,Bitter and a disappointment,I bought these at my local grocery store. I wish I would have read the review on here first. The positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin. The negative is they are so bitter. I could barely finish my half. I just recently found out I have Celiac Disease  so I cant have gluten. I have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so I can not compare it to any others. I have tried the Betty Crocker Gluten Free brownie mix and that is wonderful. So I do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there.,
B000FDKQC4,Dane Mom,A break from allergy baking from scratch,"These muffins will not win any prizes for flavor.  I agree with other reviewers that the aftertaste is somewhat bitter and compared to (at least what I remember of) real muffins with sugar, gluten, eggs, butter, and that other good stuff they are quite fine. I do not eat gluten, derivatives of sugar cane, eggs, soy, dairy, corn . . . I could go on but you get the idea.  In order to use this mix I had to make substitutions and was delighted with what tastes like a treat to me.  Aside from the fact that I don't have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch, the best thing about these muffins is the texture.  Texture is a challenge absent gluten, sugar, and eggs, and I found this to be very much like how I remember muffins.  The bits of dried apple make these chewy and kind of weirdly so. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.",
B000FDKQC4,Mom of 3,Very good mix!,"I have 2 children with food allergies, so I have to use egg, milk and butter substitutions for these muffins, and it works well.  I add a little more sugar to the mix and top the muffins with a brown sugar and pecan mixture before I bake them.  All my kids love them!  You can top with just brown sugar if you cannot have or do not like pecans.  I love these muffins as well!",
B000FDKQC4,"Qbrozen ""dmbrosen""",Good and GLUTEN FREE,"Folks who are comparing this to Hodgson's blueberry muffin mix obviously don't require gluten-free products (since the blueberry are whole wheat muffins). If, like me, you require gluten free, this is a great product. This is the first flavorful GF baked good I have stumbled upon. Very simple and quick to make. Like all GF products, they are pretty dense in the end, but the apples make for a nice addition and they fill you up. Personally, I added a bit more ""sugar"" (xylitol) than the recipe calls for. Next batch, I will also add some fresh apples and extra cinnamon. My only complaint is that you get so little out of the box (makes 6 small muffins).",
B000FDKQC4,FLRoss,So many mixed reviews..,"I was really excited and surprised when I found this mix in my local Wal Mart. Given it was a good price, I figured Id give it a shot . before I whipped up a batch I figured Id do a little investigating to see if there was any input/ suggestions on the mix. WOW. Is everyone using the same mix or what? Reviews from ""its great"" to ""its horrible""..like a total 50/50 split. SOOOooo, before  I wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself, I figured Id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix, all on its own . ummmmm, yeah. It TOTALLY has a pretty strong bitter after taste. :/ And , like another reviewer, I had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener (I dont like things very sweet, at all) but its DEF not. As I re read the ingredients I realized there isnt ANY sugar/sweetener in this mix so, youd def NEED to add sweetening. But, overall, I dont even plan on taking this mix that far. Im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away. Thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away .. Id strongly suggest avoiding this mix . I hope the company works on this mix. It has good elements to it (I like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty) and I think it COULD be really tasty.",
B000FDKQC4,Charlottean,Nasty,"If I could, I would give it zero stars.  I am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise (can you say hockey puck), was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added.  Save your money.",
B000FDKQC4,River City Carole,Great muffins!,"These muffins were very good made according to the recipe on the box, but when I changed the recipe a little, by substituting almond milk for the 2% milk, and extra virgin olive oil for the butter, they were great!  Next time, I am going to try adding some grated carrots and not adding the sugar.  Thank you Hodgson Mill for a wonderful gluten free product.",
B000FDKQC4,A. Clark,Simply Nasty,"I bought this because I have celiac disease and was really craving some muffins.  I am not a health nut, I just can't eat gluten.  With that said, this is nasty.  It calls for very little sugar, I figure for the health nuts, so I simply added more sugar since it said to sweeten to taste.  Even with extra sugar, it leaves an extremely bitter taste in your mouth.  I would rather pass on muffins than ever taste something like this again.  On a positive note, the muffins do stay together and look like muffins and if you try the product and dislike it, you can mail in the bottom of the box and your purchase price for a refund.",
B000FDKQC4,Jade Wyatt,Probably would be better to make something like this from scratch,"I concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste! I also bake often and I'm certain it wasn't me. My gluten-eating husband didn't like them either. They were also dense.  If you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix, you might be better off using Pamela's Baking Mix (which is awesome!) and adding apples and cinnamon to it. The muffin recipe is on the back of the Pamela bag.  In conclusion, I don't recommend these; they were really disappointing.",
B000FDKQC4,chucklor2,Very good for a store bought mix,"My family really liked these muffins.  I also made them while on vacation at my sister's house, and her family loved them.  I just got back from a Bible study full of pretty picky eaters, and they all said they were good.  They're usually pretty honest about how the gluten-free food I take tastes, even telling me once that some store-bought cookies I took tasted like cardboard. I did notice a VERY SLIGHT bitter aftertaste, but it was not too bad.  I think next time I make these I may take the advice of one other reviewer and add a grated apple for that extra touch.  Oh, and I only added 3 TBS of sugar and think they were really good, as did everyone else who ate them.  I'm sure that if you add even more sugar, the slight aftertaste could disappear altogether. I just went to the Hodgson Mills website and saw that they did recently change the formulation to this mix, so maybe that improved the aftertaste.  This mix does not have garbanzo flour.  They use sorghum instead, now.  I did not make these as muffins.  I found that one box is perfect for 2 mini loaves, which I prefer to muffins.  Very good.  I will continue to make these when I need something fast and don't have time to make it from scratch. Oh, and to the poster who asked about gluten free pasta, Tinkyada makes a great brown rice pasta.",
B000FDKQC4,S. Markowitz,YUMMY!!!,"I recently discovered that I have sensitivities to dairy and wheat, so I have been trying gluten free products.  I knew about Hodgson Mill because of their Oat Bran hot cereal, which is really good and soothes my tummy.  Consequently, I ordered Hodgson Mill gluten free pancake and waffle mix, as well as their apple cinnamon muffin mix.  Both have proven delicious.  Even my husband, who is not gluten sensitive, loves the pancakes.  I made waffles from the apple cinnamon mix this morning, and they were really good and very filling.  Not sure if the formulation has changed since the previous negative reviews, but I have no complaints, and I am very picky.  I just wish Hodgson Mill products were more readily available in our local stores.  If anyone has tried their gluten-free pasta, please post because Lundberg's rice pasta left a lot to be desired. Thanks!",

I think they taste better than any other graham cracker I've tried, and they're organic to boot.  As far as sugary snacks go, they have pretty healthy ingredients. I like pretty much everything I've tried from Earth's best.  For those of you interested in how they're sweetened they contain organic invert syrup, organic evaporated can juice, and organic honey.  They don't have anything ""scary"" in them like maltodextrin or other such sweeteners.  Just vitamins and natural, organic products.",

B000ER1DIM,Dinah,Taste and smell were intolerable.,"I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.  Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them.",

B00113XJQW,"Paba ""electronicnutt""","OMG, What a life saver","I have a pure breed GSD and had problems for years with upset stomach, eating grass and throwing up bile in the morning and then would not eat as her stomach was too upset.  It finally dawned on me that due to throwing up bile in the am was that the food was not staying with her.  I even tried feeding her before going to bed at night and still did not work.  I tried Evo and I could not believe the change.  She does not get us up at night to go outside.  She was having 3-4 bowel movements every day and now she has 1 or sometimes 2.  I have had her on the Evo large bites for almost a year now and she has not been sick once.  It is the higher protein in this food that stays with her longer and has made all of our lives so much better.  Thank you, thank you EVO!!!",
B00113XJQW,"Jane Schacher ""bird lover""",So worth it!,"We have a Golden Retriever and had been feeding him the Wellness dog food.  He ate it begrudgingly so we decided to find something else.  I read the ingredients on the Evo red meat and was really impressed.  I gawked at the price but decided cheaper dog food isn't really a bargain if your dog won't eat it or get any enjoyment out of it.  The first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it- and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough!  I agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up.  He is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him, although I wish the price were a little more reasonable.",
B00113XJQW,Ellie A. Creek,Great Food!,I have been feeding my GSD the red meat formula for about 6 months and all I can say is WOW. Before I started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. Although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! You feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. His skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. The only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools-but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. All in all if you can afford to feed them EVO its well worth the investment!,
B00113XJQW,"CJA ""halcyongfx""",Best food for your best friend,"When I got my dog I did a lot of research regarding dog food and dog food ingredients. There are high quality dog foods like this one out there, but you probably won't find them in regular supermarkets. While this food may be more expensive than other dog foods, it is well worth it. Innova Evo is one of the foods that were NOT affected by the recall. Also, the ingredients are healthier, and don't have high wheat/grain content or nasty additives. My Doberman used to have a lot of dandruff and had some skin problems. Also her poop was really mushy, almost diarrhea. When I finally switched her to Innova Evo Red Meat I'd wished I'd done it sooner. She doesn't need to eat quite as much, and her coat is beautiful! No more dandruff problems and her skin is great.",

B00113XJQW,"NGriewahn ""scoobymg47""",Perfect for the sporting dog,"I have a 2 1/2 year old 60 pound German wirehair pointer.  We feed this food during hunting season due to his increased metabolic needs.  He burns so many calories, he eats 8 cups of this food a day (with zeal).  We use the large bites to help keep the tarter and plaque off of his teeth (and to slow his eating).  Due to the high quality of this food, he can keep up his energy, keep his weight up, and recover more quickly from scrapes/bumps from running the field.  Our vet's exact words were, ""Your dog is an example of perfect health.""  You may think the price on this food is high, but it is worth it.  You get what you pay for.  Also, consider the canned version of this food.  It is a nice way to feed/hydrate a dog after a long day hunting - just give them an hour to settle down first.  On a side note, we feed Diamond Naturals Beef and Rice in the off season.  We have no digestive issues transitioning from one to the other (we switch over a period of a few weeks).",
B00113XJQW,M. Evans,Excellent nutrition,"Complete, protein-based nutrition.  My dogs love this although I'm not sure the pibble actually tastes it, she inhales it so fast.  ;) Regarding the other users who have had diarrhea issues:  My gastro-picky GSD (is that a word? I think other GSD owners will understand!) has had this as well.  Initially, I overfed this food, thinking that he needed to be eating the same amount as he had been eating the other stuff.  You feed MUCH less of this product.  It is nutrient-dense, and not all filler like other foods.  If you over-feed, you increase the risk of unpleasant side effects. It's a bit pricey, and I haven't broken down the cost per day, but since you feed less it might be competitive with other brands if someone was inclined to ""run the numbers"".",
B00113XJQW,Sam,No more shedding,My wife switched our dogs to this food about 4 months ago and she has virtually gone from vacuuming daily to once a week.  The dogs hardly shed at all anymore. No more brushing needed and their coats are very soft and shiny.  We have used other grain free foods previously and liked them but this one is definitely the best we have tried.  It's pricey but we are able to feed them 1/2 of what we were using on the other foods and still maintain the same weight.  This food is well worth the price and the dogs love it.,

B0045IK1CK,Jackie,Delicious!!,"My husband and I are not coffee drinkers, but we love hot chocolate. We hated the time it took to heat up the water,and the mess the dry mix sometimes makes. We saw that the Keurig coffee maker did other things like hot chocolate and tea, liked that it was almost instant hot water, and bought one. I ordered another brand of hot chocolate k-cup, and absolutely hated it. It had a weird almost metallic taste that was not sweet or chocolately. I was worried I wasted my money on a maker I would never use. I decided to try another brand and purchased the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa, and we absolutely love it! It is sweet and chocolately without being too bitter(which is why I originally steered away from the dark chocolate). I fully recommend this product!!",
B0045IK1CK,Shannon Schokora,Artificial taste,"These cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - I didn't realize until I tried one, and ended up with a little bit of a headache, which made me check the ingredient list - it isn't noted on the front of the box.

Our k-cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we've tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa. The first try was very watery so I thought the cup size needs to be reduced.

The coffee K-Cups have a screen inside the cup to keep the coffee grounds in the K-Cup, it also makes the last drop of liquid to fall into your cup as much coffee as the first drip.  These Cafe Escape Hot Cocoa K-Cups don't have a screen the chocolate powder empties out of the K-Cup as fast as it can, so that the last amount of water to come out of the Keurig is mostly water and it sits on the top of your cup.  So STIR it before drinking it, otherwise all you taste is the sweetener.  Also these K-Cups are made for 8 oz serving size, so use the appropriate cup size for your taste.",

B0045IK1CK,Margret Schmidt,Try Grove Square instead,"After trying several of these k-cups, we threw the rest of the box away.  It only ever created flavorless brown water.  We then tried the Grove Square dark chocolate cocoa k-cups, and were much happier.",
B0045IK1CK,Candace Smith,Dark chocolate cocoa,"This seems to be the best brand that I have tried.  Others have been very weak in flavor, but not htis one.  I would truly recommend this for Moms who have small children and need the hot chocolate after playing in the snow.  Grab the marshmellows and enjoy!  Grammie Smith (6 grandkids)",
B0045IK1CK,MuxDux,Sure puts the chalk in chalkolate,"Sure to be a hit with chalk-a-holics everywhere, from first sip to last this product suggests its European heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern France. Some seem to be making a case for it only having 60 calories, but the Keurig Chai Latte only has 70, and that product actually tastes pretty good. I have yet to find a Keurig-compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old Swiss Miss, scooped from a tub or a foil packet. And Swiss Miss isn't that great to begin with, although it sure is cheaper than this stuff. I wonder if the size of the Keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup, so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised.",
B0045IK1CK,christine,Cafe Escapes Dark Choloate hot cocoa,This product is not sweet enough for me and tastes better with marshmellows already in the cup while brewing. Watery texture was a disappointment.,
B0045IK1CK,"E. Treants ""tree""",Absolutely Delicious,"This is a much better Hot Chocolate than some of the reviews would have you believe.  My wife does NOT drink coffee (calls it ""Yuck"") and I am very particular about my coffee, BUT we agree that this is an absolutely delightful hot chocolate.  I use a medium cup size setting and it seems to be the best one for this brew.  This chocolate comes in as a not so close second to some of the great hot chocolates we have had while traveling Europe, however this did save us airfare. But this is not at all bad for an instant cup of pleasure.  Adding marshmallows or topping with whipped cream would take it over the top. If you are one of the ones who wants to throw yours away, please send my way.  I will get rid of them for you.  Thanks!) I got this product directly from Keurig as one of my two free when I registered my new brewer and purchased two.  Could not beat that price here, but at normal prices, this is the deal. From the package: 60 Calories, 2g fat, 11g Carbohydrate, 1g Fiber, 7 G sugar, 1g protein.  Ingredients: Sugar, Alkalized Cocoa powder, creamer (and all of those ingredients, etc.",
B0045IK1CK,boonepharm,Seriously???,"This one has a major problem. It's waaaay too watery, even at the recommended settings. The chocolate flavor is okay, and it's not overly sweet (although it still isn't great dark chocolate flavor). The really issue is that there isn't any creaminess, and adding milk only dilutes the flavor even more. Blech! I'll pass, and I'm throwing the rest of the box out.",
B0045IK1CK,"Ozgoddess ""BBB""",Nasty watery drink,"Just got a new keurig and immediately went on a search for  the best dark rich bold coffee (Caribou Mahogany) and other brands  with rich taste (Wolfgang is winning so far) but really wanted to find  the best hot cocoas and got these first now trying to give them away.  The are even worse than the packaged kind you get in the stores. Actually,  I think I've found better instant ones. I hate to write a bad review but..if  you want to find a DELICIOUS cocoa mix in the K-cups get the Grove (Station) brand  here on Amazon.  They are always sold out (which DUH I know why now as they are a far better  tasting brand) but if  you put your email on a wait list, they'll let you know when they come in and  you dont have to wait very long.  I'd stock up though, as you'll find you want a cup  or two every night! (and the dark, milk and peppermint combined box is the bomb!!)I just  sent a couple boxes out to a friend of mine who was complaining about how bad the k cup hot  chocolates were .she'll be thrilled to get my care package!!",
B0045IK1CK,"A. Reinhart ""ALR1""","YUCK! -all sucralose flavor, no chocolate",Gross! I tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes.

I had to get Navitas and found they were smaller, drier and less flavorful. So here I am -- this brand's golden berries are large, with a wonderful more succulent texture. The only problem is sometimes I get the seeds stuck in my teeth! They have tiny white seeds like raspberries but the berry itself resembles a large golden raisin. The flavor is very strong and captivating -- like a lemon with the tartness strength of a cranberry. Within days of incorporating golden berries into my diet I have noticed my insides are thanking me. Golden berries are naturally very anti-inflammatory. They have an addicting flavor that I will gladly continue to feed into.",
B004SFNFEG,The South Face,Wow! Really good!,"Imagine if you made a craisin out of a berry that tasted like a lemon instead of cranberry. These are very tart, which I love. I eat whole lemons so tart is fine by me. These are not super sweet either, which is refreshing.",

Just the right sweetness, just the right hotness.  I'd love to soak a chicken in it, as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets. These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more, fer shure.

If you toss chicken wings in it, you will have some great bar food in your own home!  Another idea: combine Sweet Chili sauce, heavy mayonnaise, granulated garlic, finely chopped parsely, ginger powder, and splash of siracha - this will give you a delicious sweet chili aoli perfect for burgers, sandwiches, egrolls, potstickers, fries, fish, or even chicken.  Like I said - it is good by itself, but serves as a great base for other things (from salad dressing to marinade).  Buy this sauce in bulk as you will find youself using it on everything!",

Sometimes when I have a lightly seasoned or plain piece of beef or chicken, I put some Sweet Chili Sauce on my rice. Wow that perks up the whole plate. Other times I cook the meat without seasoning and add what every flavor I'm in the mood for when I reheat it. I've kept open bottles in my refrigerator for months without any problem. If you have never tried this, the sauce is thicker than Heinz Ketchup so you can slowly add sweetness and heat until its just right for you. Another way to use this is on steamed vegetables and you can add peanuts or sliced almonds just before serving.",

Yep, you guessed it, Amazon sent me a new pack of two, and asked me to return the unbroken original. It's only cost me a little time, but how much it's going to cost Amazon to ship and process that returned bottle, your guess is as good as mine. Is it REALLY beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle?",

B00016UX0K,Giordano Bruno,Can't Afford a Trip to Thailand?,"Here's a tiny consolation: easy Thai barbecued chicken! Cut your usual fryer in quarters, cook it slowly over charcoal or quickly in a hot oven, and then brush it generously with ""sweet chili sauce"" and cook it just a few minutes more. Most authentic with 'sticky' rice but also delicious with brown or red rice. In Thailand, people squat over hibachi-sized braziers on the sidewalks and sell portion of this sort of barbecued chicken. Sometimes they trot alongside inter-city buses as they pull into stations, and sell chicken through the windows. Don't be squeamish! This is a treat you'll remember. The same sauce will enhance the flavor of any fowl from blackbird to condor or whooping crane.",

Since then, (about 5 yrs ago) my mother, friends, and I have all used this sauce on fried chicken wings, grilled and sauteed chicken, pork, spring/egg rolls, and even sushi!  I keep the large 25 oz bottle in my fridge year-round, and this is the best brand I've used thus far.  Not too hot for those not accustomed to very spicy foods, but is mostly sweet.

I purchased the 12 oz. bottle at a local store, and I must say it's one of the most addicting sauces I have ever had! I'm a pretty picky eater, and a vegetarian at that, so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one. This sauce is ALMOST perfect. It's very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand, which I didn't like much at all (thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! The only thing I have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear ""skin"" that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all, just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still, I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you, know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce. I don't care where or how, just buy it. You'll fall in love!",

B001HTKO86,Matthew T. Carpenter,Easy Indian cookingat home,"Patak's sauces have many uses but I always make a basic chicken curry.  A friend from India taught this recipe to me, and now I always have a jar or two on hand.  If you want you can get one of the Indian pickles/relishes as a garnish.  This is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing.  Typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish, and serves 3-4 adults.  I always make at least a double batch; it's just as easy and that way I have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat.  You can use any rice, but basmati is so fragrant that it is what I prefer.  Some Indian groceries have frozen Naan you can heat in the oven for an even more satisfying dinner. Ingredients:      lbs chicken breast cut into 1-2"" cubes  1 cup nonfat plain yogurt  Salt  3 tbs Patak's curry paste, flavor/heat depending on your taste 1 (generous) tsp cumin seed  1 (generous) tsp mustard seed  1 small onion diced  3 cloves garlic diced  2 medium potatoes, diced same size as chicken cubes  2-3 carrots, diced same size as chicken cubes  1 14 oz can diced tomatoes with juice    cup frozen peas  2-3 tbsp cooking oil  Salt to taste 1. Add chicken yogurt, curry paste and about   tsp salt to a bowl; mix thoroughly and let marinate while you prepare vegetables  2. Heat oil in large frying pan over medium heat until hot  3. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds, stir.  They are ready when mustard seeds start to pop.  Do not let them burn.  4. Add onion and garlic.  Saute until soft.  Stir constantly or else it will burn.  5. Add carrots and potatoes.  Saute until potatoes are just about ready to eat.  You have to stir very frequently or they will stick/burn.  I do not let anything caramelize.  6. Add chicken/yogurt mixture.  Saute a few minutes until chicken is about half cooked through.  Lower heat to low.  7. Add tomatoes and let simmer until the juices cook down a bit, and chicken is cooked through.  8. Add peas for color.  Add salt to taste.  9. Serve over freshly cooked basmati rice.  Remember to soak the basmati rice prior to cooking or it will be hard.",

I used to be a coffee drinker, but I much prefer tea -- specifically, Ashbys Afternoon Tea -- now, and I just gave away a bag of coffee I'll never drink. I never quite got why British people are so into tea, but -- whether this is a typical British tea or not, I don't know -- I now see why they'd build their afternoons around a high-quality tea like this one. Sublime.",

Personal preference I'm sure, but I like this because it's slightly firm (not hard but not soft) and the sweetness is just right.

B000X2CWTM,J. Offenbach,Doesn't leave my teeth black,"Some licorice products leave the teeth with a black film but not so with the Panda soft licorice chews.  It is a delicious licorice product that improves with age, in my opinion.  The candy from a freshly opened box is very soft and tends to stick in the teeth more than candy from a box which has been opened and closed for several days because it hardens as air circulates around the candy.  If I place it in an airtight container, it remains soft, but I really love it as the texture changes.  The flavor is consistently delicious and it is now my licorice of choice.  I was expecting the box to contain a plastic bag but it simply has a plastic seal along the top of the box with nothing inside to seal.  Therefore, if you want your licorice to remain fresh, I'd recommend placing it in an airtight container.  I've also purchased the raspberry flavor but haven't tried that yet.  I have a hard time considering fruit flavored candies as ""licorice,"" but enjoy the confection also.",
B000X2CWTM,Gary Peterson,Mmmmmmmm!,"I've always liked licorice candy and the best licorice I've ever had was obtained at Ikea. It was from Sweden. Yum!

Good aftertaste. I'd rank it with the best I've had. It's imported from Finland and is made from all natural ingredients. In my opinion, it doesn't quite make it up to the licorice I obtain at Ikea, but it's close. Gary Peterson",

While at the Norway part of Epcot at Disney FL this year I found the same thing. Then I realized it is a company brand name made in Finland not a zoo promotion. I bought some more. It cost $5 per 7 oz box. When I got home I checked several websites and Amazon was the cheapest. Pack of 12 boxes total cost shipped to me(there was a free shipping deal) Came to $2.50 per 7 oz box.

The Merula oil itself was excellent - a great treat.",
B002979DP0,M. Erb,Delicious alternative to soda,"My review is of the Strawberry-Melon flavor only. I did not try the other flavors in the variety pack as I puchased mine individually. I don't usually drink these types of beverages, nor do I drink much soda. I generally dislike overly sweet, artificial ingredient laden stuff. Quite by chance I tried a Strawberry Melon FUZE slenderize beverage and really liked it. What I liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar, although it does have sucralose as a sweetener (rather than aspartame). It was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced; I could clearly distinguish both flavors.  FUZE was really tasty, no strong aftertaste and no sugar ""heaviness"" in the mouth. It was honestly the first time I've had this type of beverage other than a Snapple Tea beverage that I would purchase again. I'm a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro-nutrients that are added to this beverage; L-Carnitine, Super Citrimax and Chromium. Perhaps it's a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial. Nonetheless, I found this beverage to be refreshing, tasty and something I would buy again. It is a little bit pricey though. Compared to a 12-pack of store brand Diet Soda, which in my neck of the woods ia around $2.99 or a little over $.02/ounce, FUZE beverage is priced $24.99 for 15-18.5 ounce bottles, or a little over $.09/ounce. That makes it more than 4 times as expensive as the store brand diet sodas. In spite of the price, I would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute. 5 stars.",
B002979DP0,Eileen Fitzgerald,Excellent Soda Alternative!,"I don't drink a lot of sugary drinks and soft drinks.  I try to watch sugar intake and dislike overly sweet drinks.  By chance, I tried one of the Slenderize drinks and was amazed.  The drink is truly lightly sweet, using natural fruit juices, acesulfame-potassium, and sucralose as sweeteners.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who would like a soft drink replacement that still isn't as sweet as a typical ""diet"" drink.",

B001M074MY,Old Codger,Tight Fit,"The Melitta Java Pods Have a slightly smaller circumference than the Senseo pods and are thicker. If you are using a Senseo coffee machine, you probably should moisten the Java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid. Otherwise, you risk breaking the latching mechanism. The resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the Senseo decaf pods. The Melitta Java pods are not really designed for the Senseo machine and several other brands such as Halo, Fratello and Millstone work better in the Senseo machine.",

Someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging.  I have not encountered that problem.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.",
B001M074MY,liane douglas,just ok,Some issues with the product -- some of the pods are not sealed properly so the grounds spill out (either before use or after use into your coffee); it is wasteful that each pod is individually sealed -- would rather they be packaged like the Senseo pods; the pods don't really fit my Senseo coffee maker -- too fat for the single and too small for the double which causes problems sometimes when I brew a cup.  On the plus side -- price.,

Also, to help you evaluate this response better, you should know that I like quality roast Kenya AA or Sumatra or Columbian Supremo, etc. rich flavor type coffees.

When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta-brand ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others weren't available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee.",

B003159ETE,"L. L. Mills ""Words-R-Us""",What this does for lamb!!!!,"Not sure it should be legal. We put this --and a few other spices I won't share here--on some lamb chops and just fried them. They were AMAZING. This spice tastes pretty hot by itself, which makes it a bit hard to figure out how a blend with it and other spices is going to turn out. The end result, strangely, was not hot at all. Since I like spicy, I would usually have been disappointed, but this was so good, I did not even CARE. Seriously--you have to try this. I ordered two other spices at the same time, neither of which will be getting a GOOD review.",

B005GX7GVW,"Juli A. Lee ""JingleJL""",Great and good price!,"I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.

B005GX7GVW,Smeggy,Yum!,"This soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours. Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :) One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.) Oh well, can't have it all .",
B000GEVGXA,A. Thompson,"Truffle Oil? Well, at least the oil is real.","I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that ""truffle oil"" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles."" Read it and weep: [ ] And if you see ""truffle oil"" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes ",

B008G01KM8,Ryan D. Crompton,"Good Malta, baffling business model","I've never had Sunchy Malta before (I drank a lot of Goya when it was available locally). Tastes similar to Goya, though with less of a sour taste and slightly less carbonation. I ordered 50 bottles in order to get free shipping. Said bottles arrived in 4 large boxes, with each bottle individually packed. None broke. At the time of purchase, this was the best deal going for Malta either locally or in stores (I've never paid less than fifty cents anywhere). Now, though, the free shipping is gone. Unless  Sunchy seriously expects me to drop $7.50 for shipping per bottle, it's unlikely I'll be buying anymore. They should consider selling by the pack or case if they wish to pursue the online business model. So, 5 stars for value and the quality of packing, with the caveat that I won't be buying any more until Sunchy figures out how to sell it.",
B003SO2CV0,Carol Lynn,No worries!,"After reading that corn (and of course pop corn) was heavily sprayed with pesticides and agriculture uses lots of chemicals in the soil to grow it, I decided enough was enough. It was time to spend a little more and get organic. Supplier shipped quickly. Eden Foods puts out a great product. (Edenfoods.com). Certified organic and pops up nicely. I use a brown lunch bag (top folded down) with 2 TB of corn and 45 sec. in the microwave. (Your microwave time may vary). Voila! perfection. Add some splenda/cinnamon/cocoa powder mixture and yum yum. (mixture sticks really well if you spray popcorn with a little cooking spray) Only 80 calories for 2 TB! No worries!",
B003SO2CV0,zonlyone,Meh,"It's not real crispy, sticks to your teeth and lots of hulls. I know homemade popcorn has a few more kernel hulls than your store-bought microwave, but it's a little too much for me. I was really hopeful for this brand. But, it just didn't work out. I tried a couple of different methods; popped using different temperatures, and also tried different oils. It was the same both times with no improvement. It doesn't get better after it cools either..nothing worked to improve it. It doesn't taste old, so I know it's not that. I seal my popcorn kernels when I'm not using them as well. The flavor is really mild and it's definitely a good tasting popcorn. It just doesn't turn out the way it should.",
B003SO2CV0,"Mimi Taylor ""nightingale 7""",yummy popcorn,"It is very good popcorn.  But I used a hotair machine so may not have been as yummy as if the oily stuff had been used.  Although I did pour oil on afterwards.  Why would I do that with an airpopper you ask?  Because the airpopper was a gift.  I really can't tell a whole lot of difference in the taste from Orville R. and this, but what I have read is this is organic and much better for you.  But the price is well pricey. No I don't intend to buy again for that reason, but should my conscience tweek me towards healthier choice popcorn again then I may change my mind.",
B000A40OVQ,Army Wife,The only soy and dairy free shortening,This really is the only choice when it comes to soy and dairy free baking (unless you want to use lard).  The Spectrum shortening uses palm kernel oil and has the consistancy of regular Crisco (perhaps a little stiffer).  It seems to bake just fine and if you need to be soy and dairy free I highly recommend it.,

Great with almond milk and bonus points for it being organic (in as much as one can trust the ""organic"" label ). Compare to Peet's chai, I like the 500 mile better, as IMO Peet's is a little too much on the spicy side (although I do still like Peet's and some may prefer that flavor profile).",

They're probably at a spiciness level below Tobasco sauce. I tried really hard to like them but I just can't get over how watery and weak they are. The only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular Insanity sauce, but as I mentioned above, I prefer the Ultimate Insanity sauce. I guess I have plenty of salad dressings.",
B000CC9V42,T. Hardgrove,Good stuff,"I bought this gift pack and really enjoyed it. The hottest hot sauce in the pack is so darn hot it had me burning for about 30 minutes and washing my mouth out with water for 10. Other than that one, all the others were really good.

I gave the product a 3 star rating because they were tasty, but not what I was expecting. I know many of you will enjoy these and you'll probably rate these as a 5 star item, but I must be honest to provide the best rating possible. The 3 stars were for the lack of qualilty in taste.

Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste. Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample.",

You can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful Kool-Aid drink by just adding a single packet to it. Just open the bottle, pour in the contents of one packet, then close and shake. Each packet contains both the Kool-Aid mix and the amount of sugar that's needed for a single drink. Perfect size for a typical water bottle. We use reusable watter bottles with them, so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the Kool-Aid. They taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of Kool-Aid, just in a single serving size. These single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one, and end up pouring half of it out. These were such a great idea!",

B005HO0ARM,J. Fuller,I'm a man. I love this stuff.,"I'm a guy with hairy arms and hairy legs. Until I found this stuff, I was using various other body washes with my loofah. I always felt like I could never get enough suds and that the application seemed rough and difficult to quickly spread the body wash all over. Since I started using this stuff (for a few years now), I haven't looked back. This stuff is nice and soft and can create a decent amount of suds with somewhat minimal amounts of application on the loofah. It goes on smooth and ends up making my skin nice and smooth. And it rinses off nice, without leaving my skin rough. It works well, has a nice subtle smell, and I won't use anything else.",

B005HO0ARM,ExpectoPatronum,Thick body wash that lathers easily--sometimes I use it for bubble bath (Deep Moisture),"High quality body wash that is very thick and lathers quickly and easily. It has a very pleasant, flowery smell that lasts for hours after you get out of the shower. You only have to use a small amount about the size of a quarter to last your entire shower. So even though the product is expensive, you will get a lot of use out of it. It seems that the cheaper, dollar a bottle kind I sometimes use only lasts a week or 2 because I have to use more of the product to last throughout a shower. I would say the smell lasts for around 6 hours or so so it's almost like perfume. My sister-in-law asked me yesterday, ""You always smell so good. What do you wear?"" I wasn't wearing any perfume of any kind at the time because it was very early in the morning before I had done my morning routine and I had to run something over there to her. I told her that it must just be the body wash. If you have ever used Dove shampoo or conditioners, it is almost the same smell. I am looking forward to trying the cucumber/green tea kind when I run out of these 4 bottles. I would totally recommend this for yourself or for any woman in your life: aunt, mother, girlfriend, wife. I know many women who would never buy this Dove product because they always choose their children and families over themselves, ie buying themselves whatever is cheapest. I intend on buying some of this for my mom and aunt to maybe put in a gift basket or care package for them. I also use this as bubble bath when I take a nice hot bath. Excellent product. A+ from me.",

(25oz eliminates the frustrating last bit at the bottom, anything smaller store the remaining in a drawer in the corner upside down so you can squeeze the rest in the bottle without fighting with it too much, by the time you get to that second half in the bottle it'll be where you want it and you don't come out the shower looking like you got into a fight with a Dove Soap Deep Moistruizing Body wash bottle   XD",

These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of ""calms"" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion. Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not ""crispy"" cookies, or the blurb would say ""crispy,"" rather than ""chewy.""  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet. So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.

B000UZVPKO,K. Whitfield,"Healthy, tasty, convenient, and not too expensive","Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. They are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--I sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture.",
B000UZVPKO,"M. joanTretter ""camper""","NOT really low sodium, a lot more salt than 35mg","This is a very tasty product. Tastes more like tuna. However I believe the 35mg of salt listed on the indgredients for a 1/4 cup serving is much lower than the actual salt content. I use very little salt and these are somewhat salty. I also opened a can of Crown Prince natural brisling sardines in water which has a salt content of about 45 mg. The crown prince tasted much less salty than the Roland sardines. So I think Roland needs to be a little more careful about their packaging and list of ingredients. My guess is the salt content is comparable to a can of water packed tuna, maybe 210 mg or higher per 1/4 cup serving.",
B000UZVPKO,K. Leong,skinless sardines in water,Skinless sardines in water differ from the ones with skin in oil in that they are somewhat coarse and dense as opposed to the softer texture of sardines in oil.  Not much fishy odor and the liquid is flavorful.,
B000UZVPKO,bill morton,Amazon sardines good for low sodium dieters,"I like this product much better than the canned sardines I am able to find at my local grocery stores.  I buy Rolland and Seasons ( both sold by Amazon ) and in my opinion they are superior in both taste and texture.  It is a toss up for me as to skinned and boneless opposed to the skin on with bones - I like both - there are probally more nutrients in the ones with bones, which, along with the omega 3s is the plus factor for sardines.  They work for me.  I have eaten them since I  was a kid - I'll turn 80 in July. Incidentally, my cat is crazy about them too.",
B000UZVPKO,SRRT,An excellent item for an excellent price,"Sardines are rising in popularity as people discover more about their health benefits  and that they aren't so stinky after all (especially less so after cooking!). I've used numerous varieties of the Roland sardines: olive oil, s&b in olive oil, tomato sauce, etc.  The S&B version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendation/preference: a great value for the money, and practically a steal when you compare -per ounce- the price with other brands.  Then, consider the discount(s) when purchasing through Amazon, and it'll be tough to choose another.  Why?  Many other brands charge the same price as -or more than Roland- with only a 3.5-oz tin, whereas Roland includes more fish in the tin.  The quality is consistent, and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir-fries, salads, pasta dishes, etc. without overpowering the other flavors. Oddly enough, I was half-mindful when perusing a semi-local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city.  I was looking to make some lower-cost and healthier choices in my diet at the time (not expecting to find these, of course, but rather turning my nose up at the usual crud I saw stocked there) when I accidentally stumbled across them.  At $1 per tin, it was a huge buy, so I tried a few.  The rest, as they say, is history as aforementioned.",

I also grow this in trays for my 2 cats who live indoors, deprived of valuable natural chlorophyll. All mammals need it, and we are now enjoying a strong, healthy organically grown variety which is easy to grow and lasts a long time. Wheat grass has larger blades than lawn grass which does not induce the cats to being sick. They crave it and are very healthy with glossy soft coats, their energy levels are better, and they are playing more. Both are perfectly healthy. Chlorophyll is kind of like eating liquid sunshine mixed in with vegetation. It does a body good! If you care about your (or other) bodies, then get this very nice product.

B000CMHMUC,"S. Walsh ""School Bus""",Reboot your snack processors,"I wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the 5 stars (and ordering them all the time).  I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food.  I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right?  So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged.  How could this be BBQ?  They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything.  I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed.  (I know ""I thought you said 5 stars.""  It gets better.) Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps.  I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again.  What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps.  I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder.  I polished the next bags off in three days. Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food).  My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful.  Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips.  You'll feel better about snacking!",
B000CMHMUC,Hamptons NY,Fantastic taste and good for you!,"I found out about these from a co-worker. They are delicious, low calorie, and pack some protein.

It's lightly salted, and doesn't have 12 different fattening, unhealthy seasonings and flavorings. One entire bag is only like 350 calories. It's actually quite good.

I admit, it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first.  When I opened them, they looked totally unappetizing and then I tasted them  it tasted just like a rice cake/styrofoam with salt on it.  They also have a very unusual texture.  The combination of taste and texture was very disappointing.  My teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way - not even the dog would eat them.  We tried them with a variety of dips and couldn't come up with a tolerable way to choke them down. Luckily, I have a niece that is newly vegetarian, hungry all the time, and she took these off my hands.  I am still out $25 for buying the case of these to begin with what a waste!",

I must be square:  I confess I really depend on the flavor of Lipton tea. Here's a tip: we used to drink expensive coffee in the morning which would almost always let us down about 11 am.  The switch to green tea has been wonderful and permanent.  I still like having coffee sometimes at about 3 in the afternoon, but in the morning tea works infinitely better for the middle-aged set.  Still gives us a nice caffeine kick for breakfast this way."
386097,B000EM6PS0,Lightning Hunter,Bleh ,"Immediately after opening a box of Lipton Mandarin Orange tea, I had a feeling it would not be good.  The smell of the tea bags reminded me of orange antacid tablets (Tums, anyone?).  I figured I would still give it a try, since tea doesn't always taste like it smells.  I was correct.  The tea tasted nothing like Tums; in fact, it had no taste at ALL.  I was relieved that I didn't have to drink tums in the form of tea, but the complete lack of taste wasn't much better.  It's rare that I dislike a tea enough to actually come onto Amazon and type a negative review like this, but this tea definitely qualifies.  I enjoy a lot of other Lipton tea - including the Island Mango & Peach, and Blueberry Pomegranate, but this tea does not fall under the category of good Lipton teas by a long shot.  If you enjoy eating orange Tums and drinking tasteless tea, go ahead and purchase this one.  Otherwise, stay away!"

The Celestial Seasonings' Orange Zinger is an herbal 'tea' that has such a great orange tang flavor, and even smells nice right out of the box. This Mandarin Orange green tea replacement from Lipton doesn't have that nice smell in the bag. When brewed even a long steep yields a pretty clear cup of hot water with a pleasant orangy aroma but virtually no flavor. When sweetened it tastes like sweetened hot water. The nice smell made me really want to like it, so I tried two of the pyramid bags in a regular cup. With the two bags and a good 5 minute steep it actually came out halfway decent - better, but not great. Also didn't care for the inclusion of Modified Corn Starch in the ingredients nor the plastic material of the pyramid bag. It might even be the plastic bag hindering the proper propagation of the tea while steeping. This is my first experience with Lipton's pyramid teas and will be the last unless another flavor comes along as a freebie and can change my mind. I'll stick to Twinings and Celestial Seasonings, both of which I highly recommend."

386101,B000EM6PS0,"Captain Aaron ""Captain Aaron of Her Majesty's ",The Elusive Mandarin Orange and the Search for the Last Great Panda King,"Mandarin Orange, such a remiscent joy, reminds me of our search for last of the Great Panda Kings. It was the Winter of 1935, Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale, our regular liaison with the Crown, informed us of an outlandish tale relayed to him by one of his Chinese servants.  Pyung Li, who in his formative years, had traveled up the Yangtze River to Wuhan, a small provincial village established during the Han Dynasty.  Pyung Li recalled stories the locals told of an ancient race of ""Bear-Men"", (silly Pyung Li, as all educated men are well aware that the Panda is not a bear at all, which is why Pyung Li was a servant), who lived further along the banks of the Yangtze River.  Pyung Li spoke in abject horror of the actions the so called ""Bear-Men"" (stupid Pyung Li) perpetrated among the locals, sordid details of which decorum prevents in such a noble forum as this one.  Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale, as many nobles, a fine swordsman, a notorious womanizer and a lover of treasure, was seduced by the tale of glorious fortunes held on by the Bear-Men.  ""But Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale"", Pyung Li quivered, ""the one call 'Panda King', he no return traveler alive, they say, Panda King make suit out of inside of traveler"". But Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale would not be persuaded, as the great treasure he sought, would definitely be his. Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale offered us Pyung Li's as a our guide for our perilous journey up the Yangtze River.  I requisitioned my usual crew, Boson's Mate Micklegal and First Mate Tignor, the most trusted of my crew.  We packed up the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendhish and so it was that we set sail for the Far East. Many weeks later, we found ourselves alone on the River Yangtze, seeking the treasure of the Great Panda King.  Pyung Li shivered in horror as the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish inched further up the river, her hull softly swaying in the friscilating dusk.  ""Boson's Mate Micklegal"", I shouted, ""all hands on deck!"".  ""Gather the crew.  Brew us up one of your fine cups of Earl Grey, a tea fit for Kings.""  (Everyone knowing well, that Earl Grey, ""The Earl"", English of course, being the finest of all the teas.).  With the warm deep taste of Earl Grey in our bellies, we almost did not hear the noises along the banks. ""Panda King and Bear-Men, he near"", Pyung Yung whispered.  ""Dammit Pyung Li"", bellowed First Mate Tignor, ""you are on her majesty's H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish, you are in the presence of fine Englishman, will you please speak the language of the Kings in proper grammatical form"". ""Great Panda King, he know we close, he send scout, he track us!"", Pyung Li warned.  And out of the blue, the starboard side of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish took on a full assault against it's hull.  The crew of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish took up their battle positions, ready for a full on naval assault against the Great Panda King's army.  Boson's Mate Micklegal almost didn't realize the fresh liquid running down his arm until it was too late. ""They're throwing bloody fruit at us!"", yelled First Mate Tignor.  ""Bloody Citrus!""  No one noticed Pyung Li scurry below deck. Before anyone realized, we were all on shore, sitting in front of the ""Bear-Men"".  In fact, the ""Bear-Men"" were not bears, nor men, they were cute cuddly Giant Panda bears, chewing on endless reeds of bamboo.  The leader of the Giant Panda's, in fact, the most Giant of them all, was The Great Panda King, the last of his species.  The Great Panda King dropped his bamboo.  With his paw, the Great Panda King rolled the small rounded orange citrus to me.  In his paws, the Giant Panda King took a bite from the rounded small orange citrus and motioned for myself to do in kind.  I did, and I let the luscious citrus run down my throat.  In return, we gave The Great Panda King the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish's only copy of the King James Bible.  We exchanged pleasantries and with that, we were gone. Later on the boat, Boson's Mate Micklegal, always the young ing&eacute;nue, set the green tea leaves given to him by Pyung Li into the kettle along with the zest of three of the small round orange citrus.  We decided to call the small rounded orange citrus a ""Mandarin Orange"", after the name of First Mate Tignor's favorite style of Chinese cooking.  After four minutes, the entire crew filled their bellies with this delicious green tea concoction.  That night, Boson's Mate Micklegal was supposed to sleep next to the small rounded orange citrus protecting it.  Unfortunately, Boson's Mate Micklegal, with an unhealthy addiction to Glen Fiddyich that he found smuggled within the hold, got plastered and did not notice Pyung Li stealing the citrus and sneaking off the H.M.S. Pergrine Cavendish and into the night. When morning came to, we realized we no longer possessed the small rounded orange citrus of our bounty so humbly given up by the Last Great Panda King.  But ever the swift thinker, Boson's Mate Micklegal whipped out the green tea leaves, found some remaining peach and mango from our previous voyage up the Nile, one summer prior and steeped us a damn fine cup of tea.  It was divine.  We loved it so much, we decided to continue calling it ""Mandarin Orange"" even though we had no ""Mandarin Orange's"" left. So I thank the hack's at Lipton, for recreating this little masterpiece for all to enjoy."

386113,B000ER3EAM,"jpslovingmommy ""jpsmommy""","""Amazing"" said the 5 month old Critic!",I fed this to my daughter for the first time today.  She is an alright eater and is pretty open to most things but she loved this and I couldn't shovel it in fast enough!  I normally give her baby cereal at breakfast and dinner and love that this one jar already had the oatmeal in it so it makes it much easier to travel with!  My daughter liked it so much I just ordered two cases from Amazon and will be coming back for more!
386114,B000ER3EAM,"Katherine Shea-Ortiz ""katherineskye""",Delicious and Healthy Baby Food!,This was my daughter's favorite type of baby food.  It actually is good and good for the little one too.  We tried a number of earth's best but always came back to this variety as our standard.
386115,B000ER3EAM,"G in H-Town ""Restless, Dexterous, Primed""",Baby Likes It,"My infant son loves most of this food.  It is easy to get cases shipped and not fumble with individual jars in the store.  Quick shipping, good packaging.  I've had no issues."
386116,B000ER3EAM,"Alissa ""amressel""",Love that POB!,We call this P.O.B. in my household and it's a standby for a quick snack.  My son is crazy about it!!!  I only wish it came in larger jars.  We'll probably have to move up to one of the 6oz. muesli or oatmeal blends soon.
386117,B000ER3EAM,"L. Tobey ""ltobes""",Thicker consistency is much appreciated,"The first prunes are good, but much too runny past 6 months.  The prunes with the oatmeal are much better for older babies who can use their hands to flail around.  These stay on the spoon much better!  It also skips the step of adding cereal grains to the food to make it a different consistency.  Older babies will appreciate the different tastes as well!"
386118,B000ER3EAM,Angela Yiu,"good, not too sweet","Good and not too sweet.  My son likes it. Banana favor is slight over powering the plum, but since my son likes banana, it was not a problem"
386119,B000ER3EAM,"Never Forget ""Mama knows best""",Must have in every baby food cupboard,"My 3 1/2 month old was eating all the time and reconstituted rice cereal with breast milk just wasn't doing the trick.  After reading what is in this (and what isn't in this), I decided to give it a try.  I LOVE this particular Earth's Best food.  My baby loves it too (I tried a few others too but this one is the winner).  Now she is sleeping more soundly and so am I. At 4 months, she eats 1 jar a day so far.  It is well worth the cost, especially if you get on Amazon's automatic monthly shipping which reduces the overall price. Being post-partum, it gives you less to try to remember too!"
386120,B000ER3EAM,sagar,My son's favorite!,My son likes the Earthbest products mote then any other brand. He simple loves to eat it all the time and above all that its wholegrain and organic. So you know you are giving best food to your baby and can't beat the prize here on Amazon.
386121,B000ER3EAM,T.Cates,Fantastic!,I love Earth's best foods and this was a price I couldn't pass up. My infant loves this combo :)
386122,B000ER3EAM,Sol,"Good product, misleading description","The description clearly states ""variety pack"", but you only get one flavor- banana apricot mixed grain. Hopefully your baby likes it. The good thing is, my baby, who is quite picky, and would only eat ""carrots"" and ""tomato & carrots"" out of the whole line up of earth's best flavors at the local grocery store, actually likes this. What I love about the fruit & whole grain combo (or other things & whole grain combo) is that this is the only way I've found to give my baby some grains without it being fortified with lots of stuff."
386123,B000ER3EAM,Natalie Willes,More Runny Baby Food,"I do not understand why some fruit and whole grain combos are thick and others, like this kind, are SO runny. Unless you mix in rice cereal with this it's impossible to feed to a baby without it getting everywhere.  Other than that, my baby seems to like the taste."
386124,B000ER3EAM,doots17,Yummy!,"I make almost all of my baby's food, but we buy some for on-the-go and unexpected outings.  The bar is set very high on taste and quality, as my 9 month old has refused to eat some brands we have tried to feed him.  I also always taste anything I feed to my son, so again, I have high expectations.  This food was a great deal, and we like the Earth's Best brand, so I bought some.  My son loves it, and I think it tastes great.  An easy way for breakfast on-the-go, instead of having to deal with mixing rice or oatmeal cereal and his fruit.  The only warning I have is that I thought I would be getting a banana/grain & apricot/grain variety pack, but it is banana/apricot/grain all in one jar.  The wording was a little confusing & the flavor on the jar pictured was really small.  But it turned out to be a hit!"
386125,B000ER3EAM,"J. Zumba ""Jules""",Good taste and good for your baby,I am not a health nut but I have tried various brands of baby food and by far Earth's Best tastes and smells better. My son loves it and he is a very picky eater. I also feel good about the fact that there are not chemicals or preservatives that may harm him.
386126,B000ER3EAM,Amanda Herman,Fruit & grains - great tasting and convenient,"My little guy just loves this jar. I am not a believer in forcing grains on my son, but he loves the Earth's Best combinations.  I am happy with Amazon's ""grocery"" business. It is great to have the convenience to order these on-line and have home delivery.  I can't imagine going the store and having to get a whole case and go through check out. I try to make him some meals, but I trust Earth's Best and love the flavor combo's and they are so convenient."
386127,B000ER3EAM,"Anthony D'Atri ""Anthony11""",It's what prunes are for,"I've bought this to help with my son's constipation.  It doesn't smell appealing to me, but he likes it just fine."
386128,B000ER3EAM,J. Lewis,Recommend,My 6.5 month son enjoyed this flavor and it helped him with his bowel movements as well.
386129,B000ER3EAM,"Judy ""Hoodi""",great for constipated baby,"Prunes really helps with the smoothness of my baby's pooping.  It really works, but make sure you don't give too much, or else there will be too much pooping and runny too."

386134,B006Z9UHIU,Robert M,Great w/ Bratwurst!,"This is a sweet mustard, using cane sugar in lieu of honey. I found it difficult to match with anything American.  I picked up some traditional bratwurst from a local German deli and BINGO! a match made in heaven.  Essential and addicting for traditional bratwurst."
386135,B006Z9UHIU,Coolaid,YUM,This is a great sweet mustard! I love it. tasted it at a german market and loved it. had to get it for home.
386136,B004S5ZZBW,mug,Dried out almost petrified,Product was way beyond dried out tasted like the shelf life past it was kinda white in some cans where the beef dried out so bad
386137,B004S5ZZBW,Bucky Buttface,Tastes god but really dry and hard and sharp!!,If you're gonna put this tween yer cheek n' gum like chewing tobacco you need to know that it will cut the inside of your lip. It tastes good and peppery once you have it in for a while and moisten it. But the little pieces are really hard and sharp. Not like the soft shredded stuff you get from 7-11. Really peppery too. But in a good way. You do get a metric ass-load of tins though. I probably passed 1/2 of em out to my friends.
386138,B004S5ZZBW,"Yvette O ""yogden""",More like sawdust than chew,The title says it all. Product had the consistency and flavor of sawdust. If you imagine taking a pinch of sawdust and stirring in black pepper you have just created the equivalent of Wild Bills Black Pepper Chew

The label contains an allergen statement that the ginger was processed on equipment that also processes peanuts, tree nuts, soy, milk, eggs and wheat. It would be very nice if the product description here would include this sort of very important information. A photo of the label which states this would be sufficient to convey this info easily."
386141,B001EO7MTS,K. Littlejohn,great price,This is a large amount of crystalized ginger and I don't think you could beat the price. I would have preferred it to be a bit more sweet to offset the heat of the ginger but it's still good.

They are about the size of potato chips. I think one must have an acquired taste for this though. Either you hate it, or you love it. I've offered it to some, and they said it tasted like potpourri crapped in their mouth. :oD But I really like it. I have a friend that LOVES it. She was just snacking away. I'm like Whoa! Kind of a spendy snack to chow down half a container in one sitting. :o) This does help if I have an upset stomach, and am feeling very nauseated. Kind of spendy, but good for a personal snack. :o)"
386144,B000N4XKEQ,Hello,Good Deal!,"The season has a good flavor, good price, and I do plan to purchase it again. I put this under the skin of a turkey as well as in the cavity and the turkey came out wonderfully!  It was not over powering!

They just aren't good, they're tough and chewy, but in a bad way.  The flavor itself is good, but the gum is just too tough to chew comfortably. If you're looking for sugar free fruit flavored gum you're better off going with the more traditional brands in smaller quantities."

The Lindt Swiss Bittersweet chocolate is the world's best, and this Lindt Surfin bar is made of the same stuff!  I prefer the thinner Lindt Swiss Bittersweet bar to allow this chocolate to roll over your tongue, but this thicker Lindt Surfin bar is always a solid backup purchase depending upon what Amazon/Lindt have in stock at the right price.  And its golden package makes it a wonderful gift to have on hand when you buy it by the box."

386154,B000YT7R80,Jennifer R. McKinney,Reminds me of McDonald Land cookies from my youth,I love these cookies. They remind me of my youth when McDonalds had their character shaped McDonald Land cookies. They provide a nice treat in the middle of the afternoon without breaking your diet. I just wish I could get them in slightly smaller quantities at the same cost. 96 of these little bags takes forever to go through. I actually wish they were in the supermarkets. They're far better than many of the animal crackers that are on the shelves now.
386155,B000YT7R80,hbee,Love Keebler Elfins,I first tasted these out of the vending machine at the rehab center where my mom was for six weeks.  Fell in love with them and decided to purchase in bulk so I could have a snack when I wanted and in my lunch bag.  I've shared with some of my co-workers and now they love them too.  These are now on my list of favorite cookies. Not too sweet and only 2grams of fat.  Can't beat that! Enjoy!

386162,B005FTNGAM,Quest4theBest,An Ok Berry Gum,"This gum is SUPER TASTY at first and the flavor lasts for a good 10 to 15 minutes, which is beyond typical for most fruit flavored gums.  What keeps me from giving it more stars is the fact it crumbles when you first start chewing, however, it does seem to re-unite it's self again once thoroughly wet.  Also, when the flavor is all chewed out it begins to take on a chemical-plastic-like taste that lingers in your mouth a bit, even after chewing.  I think I will stick with Trident fruit gums."
386163,B005FTNGAM,"Electra_SF ""Electra_SF""","Like dessert - fruity, tangy, satisfying","LOVE this flavor, and I'm usually a mint-only gum fan (though I did cross the line a few times with mint mojito - still minty but flirting with fruit). Nice berry flavor, good texture, long lasting - I usually end up throwing it away long before it breaks down or loses flavor. I find I can use this flavor as a dessert substitute. I didn't have the crumbly, plastic tasting problem that the other reviewer had with this flavor, though I HAVE had that experience with a spearmint pack that I left in the car too long. This makes me suspect that their gum was exposed to extreme heat and then ""re-set"" leaving it crumbly and plastic-tasting."
386164,B000SW4LVY,Lucky Duck,Zulka sugar,I tried a bag of this sugar because it was less expensive than other brands of sugar that aren't too highly refined.  It is as good as the higher priced brands.  I could not find it locally so bought it from amazon for a good price and am satisfied with the purchase.
386165,B000SW4LVY,"MissBanjo ""missbanjo""",Great product,I found this on the shelf at my local Walmart and decided to try it because it cost so much less than the other pure cane sugar brands.  I will continue to buy as long as I can find it.  It really is the best.

I bought it off the shelf in CA  but after moving to NC  was unable to locate a vendor  so was quite happy to find it at Amazon.com I love the smooth creamy taste of this sugar  and the fact that it doesn't leave my mouth coated  or  burn my gums.
386167,B000SW4LVY,Paula,Delcious!,"This is a very finely granulated sugar. It works great when creaming sugar and butter together. The sugar has a wonderful aroma. It has a very pretty light beige color. You can't really see it in a picture, but you can tell side by side with refined white sugar that it is light beige. The price is great and the flavor is excellent. It's a very subtle flavor in the foods that no one can really pinpoint. But if you do a side-by-side comparison with a baked product with this sugar and another with refined white sugar, there is just something more ""delicious"" about the baked good with this sugar. I highly recommend it!"
386168,B000K7H33K,Don Fosen,Good flavor but very expensive,This is good beef jerky.  Keep in mind however that you paying almost $15 for 3.75 ounce bag.  Somehow I failed to notice this when I bought it.  I am not quite sure why less than 4 ounces of something costs $8.50 to ship.

Any cat I've ever owned has turned its nose up at any other brand - I had to buy Purina or else they would go mouse hunting.  Anyway this bag is huge, much bigger than I thought.  Had to share it with other cat owners and still have a huge stash of it.  Purina rocks.  I didn't buy it from this vendor - my cost was half the price because it was prime shipping (free)."

I don't cook with it all the time but when I want some simple balsamic chicken or pork this glaze makes my life so much easier. Trying to make my own reduction glaze always took too much time.  Don't have much time any more.  This simplifies my cooking.

When they went through all there turmoil and the senseo pods were not available anymore I began trying some other brands.  I purchased a top of the line Mr. Coffee and tried store bought coffee.  It was just ok.  Then I looked some more on amazon and realized I could buy the same coffee used in the senseo pod system.  So I tried the Douwe Egberts Rood brand.  I like it.  It has a smooth taste and is very pleasant.  I recommend this highly if you like a smooth taste with no bitterness.  It works well with the old fashion mr coffee maker and sure is a heck of a lot cheaper than senseo pods were/are.

The aroma when perking is also great.  For the price, you can't go wrong.  The Aroma Rood is the only one we have tried, but I'm sure the other types are good also.  As you can imagine, Douwe Egberts is very popular in Holland.  Glad we can get it here.  Amazon has the best deal on this coffe that I have found on the internet."

That's not very nice when serving these to guests and there is no way to tell just by looking at it. Also, my last batch had one whole flavor (the chocolate-robed with green diagonal stripes) where every one of them was dry.  It only happened once and my family loves these too much to knock it down another star for that."

386196,B000KNB4WA,Penumbra,C'mon people!  Quit wasting this stuff in cookies!,"Oh, sure.  It's terrific in cookies but, if you really want a treat, try using Ghirardelli's Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips to make a truly delicious hot chocolate! You can take 1/4 cup of chips and melt them in a microwave in 1/2 cup milk.  Stir.  Then add another 1/2 cup milk, although the truly decadent will use half-and-half.  Add a pinch of cinnamon, a pinch of red pepper (yeah, you heard me), and two pinches of instant coffee.  Wow!! Ghirardelli has been making exceptional chocolate in the USA for over 150 years.  They take it from the beans all the way to the finished product. Their chocolates are smooth (not grainy).  Very nice! Highly recommended!"
386197,B000KNB4WA,T. WARFEL,Dairy-free and delicious,"These are the only dairy-free chocolate chips I have found in any grocery store, and they taste great. A tip I buy them at Walmart for less than $3.00 per bag."

Large vs small morsels, chunks, different brands, varied flavors. With these, my search is over. Not overly sweet or bitter, the correct size so I can add a ton or a meager few and a good price here at Amazon. I'll be keeping these around from now on. They also make a great hot chocolate on a cold, rainy night, improve a boring breakfast cereal, and they turn plain old pancakes into an event!"

386207,B00073JVFU,A. Davis,I liked it at first ,"The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again."

The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online."

I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals."

However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry."

It doesn't smell like that when it's brewed.

I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!"

I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.
386287,B00073JVFU,lesley9,Mild sweet tea,I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose. Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth. I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea. Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.
386288,B00073JVFU,"A. Simmons ""Readaholic""",Really works for hayfever (allergies) ,Was told by a friend to try Nettle tea for allergies. Brought it & it works great & quickly. Long time allergy suffer who loves Nettle tea. I'm able to use it & stopped all the other medications .

So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle, because I was doubled over in pain or afraid of the embarrasment of bleeding onto my clothes! A friend recomended drinking this tea and my life changed!! I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day."
386291,B00073JVFU,marie,good stuff,"this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better  eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for  about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to  go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,  yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not  set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks"
386292,B00073JVFU,Victoria Satterfield,Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!,"I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer! I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas."

I did not had to do to a GYN to cure my yeast infection. Also, it helped me in other way. After I started drinking the tea I stopped craving sugar. Needless to say, I lost like 15 pounds while drinking it. Is amazing and very medicinal. It also helps me with menstrual cramps. I love it! You can find it here online or in any natural health food store near you."
386296,B00073JVFU,Kelly,Not bad,"What can I say?  It's herbal tea, it tastes a bit grassy, but I like it.  I'd say try some before you buy a bunch of it because people either seem to love it or hate it."

I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.  I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck"

386304,B00073JVFU,"Emma M. Diaz ""Emma R.""",No more breast milk!,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply."

Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told. I find it very soothing. I was surprised that I actually like the taste. It's a woodsy taste just very appealing. It always makes me feel good afterward. The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning. This is a great product and I will most likely order it again."
386306,B00073JVFU,Jenn Barlow,Great for colicky acid reflux babies,We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.
386307,B00073JVFU,"C. Swanson ""momof3""",Recommended by herbalist--love it.,"We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in."
386308,B00073JVFU,Shauna G,Red Raspberry Leaf Tea,"I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then). This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead."
386309,B00073JVFU,reallife,I use this tea for menstral cramps,"I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot."

Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery."

Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even. Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now."

I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well."

386326,B00073JVFU,Stephanie,"Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me","I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first."

I think this tea is very light flavored. I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great. As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not."

I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective. *  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs."

I have to warn that the tea doesn't ""kick in"" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver. It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it."

I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho.

I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went. UPDATE 3/28/2012:  I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around."

386350,B00073JVFU,Maria Orfan,Please get past the taste.,"You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.  It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this. You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better."
386351,B00073JVFU,"J. Wilson ""JustWannaGetItDone""",Fenugreek Seed Tea.,Its a nice wind down at night.  Taste takes some getting used to but not too bad.  Sweeten with a litte honey.  The health benefits make up for the taste.  The product arrived as reported.
386352,B00073JVFU,Jay Dee,Good,"I bought this because I heard about the benefits of Sage tea. I got used to the taste pretty quickly and love to pour it in a glass of ice to enjoy during the summer days. I took a star off because I've been drinking it for several weeks and I'm not seeing the work of benefits that is claimed of Sage tea (but then, I've always believed that you lose some benefits when the teas are in bags as opposed to still being in leaf form?)."
386353,B00073JVFU,Rodney S. Monteith,Sage tea definitely promotes a good night's sleep.,"It was touted by a friend as a sleep inducer, so I tried it and it works.  It tastes kinda mediciney, but it definitely does the job."
386354,B00073JVFU,Stephanie,"Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good","I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon. Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!"
386355,B00073JVFU,"M. Mercado ""Amari M.""",Good price for the quantity :),It came in a timely fashion & it was a good price for the quantity I received. This tea is good for occasional constipation or to help your body along when it feels irregular.

386357,B00073JVFU,Bean Slap,Nasty tea debris everywhere!,"When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!"

386361,B00073JVFU,D. Walsh,Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes,"When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you."

I've only had one cup of it, so I can't say if it has helped my symptoms or not.  I have purchased other teas of this brand.  I would recommend their teas.  I wasn't crazy about the taste of the red clover, but that is just my personal opinion.  It's a little bitter but bearable.  Add some sugar and you're good to go."

386368,B00073JVFU,Rachel W,Interesting taste,"I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either. The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!"
386369,B00073JVFU,Worldofbooks,Saw this on Dr. OZ for eliminating crows feet,"I watched Dr. OZ on television and he was explaining how to minimize and/or avoid crows feet. His advice? Drinking Fenugreek tea, taking L-Arginine supplements and getting a good nights' sleep (6 hour min.). Well, I am going to give it a shot. This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually. I wasn't able to find this tea in any local supermarkets but here it is on Amazon. Seems they have everything!"
386370,B00073JVFU,Lulu,"Great Tea, Great Price","Tea comes in bags inside a large foil lined pouch.  There are 2 bags 'attached', and you peel them apart to use one.  They are not individually wrapped, and they do not have strings.  Strong flavor, great price."
386371,B00073JVFU,NotLime,Sage Tea helps with night sweats,"I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps! The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle."
386372,B00073JVFU,"bigtenalumnagraduate ""pseudoliterati""","Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it","I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell."

It is imported from Germany and has a very clean taste. I have used one teabag allowed to steep a little longer to yield an entire small pot of tea, which also makes it quite economical. Have tried many other brands of peppermint tea when I couldn't find this one and none measure up. This is the best!"

However, I bought this in february and UPS left it at my door, which is what they usually do.  However, I didn't bring it inside for several hours because I was at work.  By then at least half of the cans had exploded due to the soup freezing.  I had to contact amazon customer service because they do not allow the return of food, so they had to make a special exception for this.  I would not buy this from amazon again."

386382,B004T7YEUM,William J. Dyer,Not Chinese restaurant-style hot mustard,"I was hoping that the Roland Chinese Hot Mustard would approximate the ubiquitous and very, very powerful hot mustard served by Chinese restaurants with egg rolls and such. Alas, it was less like that than I'd hoped, and quite a bit like standard supermarket prepared mustard -- a slight kick, but nothing that will open your sinuses or tear up your eyes. After doing more online research, I'm next going to try something made from a mustard powder; several sources indicate that as soon as it's mixed, the potency begins to fall, so perhaps the Roland product is as good as can be found pre-mixed as a liquid or paste."

386385,B001QTRF70,Sincerely Yours,ooh another great British favourites,"I am amazed and pleased that Amazon is stocking this as part of prime delivery. This is one of many great British treats and such great value given that this is an imported product.  I have to travel over an hour and spend 3x as much to buy one and here it is all ready to be shipped.  This is exceptional value. the combination of hazelnut, sweet raisens and chocolate is so delicious and you really cant just have one segment - it is really to be eaten all in one session; try it with a cuppa tea (see PG tips) and you are getting a lovely British experience."
386386,B001QTRF70,"John B. Goode ""JBG""",Great!,"Cadbury's is by far my favorite brand of chocolate. I've tried all different types of chocolate from organic stuff, to imported stuff, to exotic stuff, to domestic brands to the very expensive stuff so it's funny that it's the proletariat everyman's Cadburys, which is in my humble opinion the best tasting. In their fruit and nut bar you get hard and soft. The nuts are crunchy and the fruit (raisins) is soft. Together you not only get gustatory pleasure but you get a textural pleasure from the mixture of something crunchy as well as something soft in your mouth. I have to admit that Cadbury's, which is tailored to the American sweet tooth is a mite too sweet and it isn't dark chocolate, which is ""good"" for your health. But who wants to live forever anyway? Chocolate is for pleasure, it's a hedonistic pleasure, if you're into health you should be eating sprouts and doing yoga, not eating this. But taste is in the end subjective, all I can do is to ask you to try it. For me, it is the best. These are the single bars. Unfortunately, they really should be two servings per bar because they are so big. I did buy this pack and you really should only eat 1/2 bar each time."

I purchased it to give as a gift but when it arrived there was more shredded paper than product, so I kept it and bought something else for our friends. I'm glad I did because the chocolate was ""waxie"" tasting and did not have a pronouced, rich, deep chocolate flavor one would expect from a company with the reputation Godiva has. The only thing worth while in the basket were the coffee mugs.  Do yourself a favor and buy some See's, Fannie May's or Rocky Mountain Chocolates instead."

When I got the honey, it was already crystallized which shouldn't be.  I would not buy this stuff if you want real manuka honey."

It was still in liquid form and not crystallized like raw honey often is. I won't go into any of the many great medicinal qualities of Manuka honey as I'm sure that if you're already looking at this item, you're aware of it. I can say that the taste was interesting. Personally, I prefer the taste of Ulmo honey (why a four-star rating instead of five) - but I will be keeping this honey on hand for any medical ailments it may help."

What I got was pizza size pepperoni in about 7-1.75oz packages. So, maybe I got more pepperoni per ounce, it's still just not what I wanted. It cost more, too, than from the other seller. What I bought was from a different seller. Somebody needs to explain to me, why, after purchasing from the other seller, I go to my list of purchased items, and click on that item, it takes me to this page of, supposedly the item I wanted, at a much better price from a different seller! If the other seller couldn't fulfill my order with exactly what I wanted, why wasn't I notified? Now, this pepperoni will probably last till forever, except that it expires the end of the year."

However, I am a fan of donuts and I will admit that the packaging made me think of a delicious chocolate donut.  I wanted to try it. I read the reviews here, which were mostly positive, and I picked up a variety box with this in it to try it. I was not disappointed! The first thing you notice as it's brewing is the smell.  It really does have a chocolate donut smell. I also like bold or dark coffee, and this isn't as strong as I'm used to, but this does well as a flavored coffee.  It has a slight cocoa flavor that is not overpowering.  I recommend brewing this on a small setting to get a more concentrated flavor.  Give it a try!."

As soon as you brew that first cup you will smell the amazing chocolate glazed donut aroma and it tastes just as good!  If you add creme and/or sugar to your coffee you will still enjoy the brewed in chocolate glazed donut taste. It is smooth, not bitter at all and just a great cup of coffee for everyday or for a treat to mix it up from a non-flavored blend."

This is not a strong coffee, if you make it with using the 9 or 11 ounce brew setting on your Keurig brewer it is weak.  Using the 7 ounce setting it is okay but not strong.  5 ounce brew setting seems to be the best for coffee strength. I prefer a bit of kick to my coffee and when I make flavored coffees I want to taste the flavor as well as smell it. I'm glad I purchased a 5 cup sampler through Keurig direct and did not buy a box of 48 as sold here on Amazon because I will not be purchasing this flavor of K-cups again."

386450,B001E5DYTY,"MadMonk ""RudeBuddhist""",Almost five stars,"Our office recently (and possibly misguidedly) voted a Starbucks machine off the island and replaced it with a couple of Bunn airpot makers. They're great for commercial coffee but that is also the problem: it tastes like mediocre diner coffee even when good beans are used. So I've taken matters into my own hands and picked up an Espressione Cafe Novecento espresso maker and have put it in the kitchen ""on loan"" to the company. My first few attempts at pulling a decent shot with fresh ground coffee convinced me that I simply don't have the patience to learn the proper technique so, as the machine came with a pod portafilter, I decided to give that a shot (so to speak). Illy had the highest number of positive recomendations so I settled on them for my initial foray. Simply put, I am impressed. The flavor is excellent, the output takes in the ballpark of 20-30 seconds a shot and has very good crema on about three out of every four shots. It can be tricky to properly seat the pod in the portafilter but moistening the pod first does help and that's a more a reflection on the filter design than the pod's. The primary reason I can't give five stars (although I'd do four and a half if I could) is that even the Amazon price works out to almost a dollar a shot so my double Americano in the morning is only slightly less than I'd pay my favorite barista. And she has a really cute smile. All in all, though, a very positive experience and I recommend the Illy pods."
386451,B001E5DYTY,Steve M,Great Convenience for Espresso Lovers,"Illy Dark Roast Pods provide a great-tasting cup of espresso with crema and without the mess of cleaning up all those grounds. The tin packaging is compact for easy storage, but I recommend keeping the opened pods in a vacuum container to maintain freshness. If you're willing to invest in two 18-pod tins, you can't beat the price on Amazon! For a slightly different great taste and individual packaging to maintain freshness, try Espressione as an alternative, though the individual packaging requires additional storage space in your cupboard."
386452,B001E5DYTY,"C. Ferretti ""tech head""","good flavor, ese pods work","These ese pods work, not mess.  Flavor is quite good.  Not as good as fresh ground, etc.  For what it is, a good product, with a nice flavor."
386453,B001E5DYTY,BeastVladden,Espresso lovers heaven,"First time I tried illy espresso  6 yrs ago  while  on business trip  in Europe. Hard  to forget taste , illy Caffe Dark Roast PODs will satisfy any espresso lover , especially when Cleaning reduced to Zero. Highly Recommended."
386454,B001E5DYTY,Janell,"Easy to use, cheap, and actually makes pretty good espresso.","So, I'll start by saying I'm sort of an espresso snob. I got an espresso machine after spending 3 days on the internet checking out the best ones and ending up with a great deal on a Francis Francis X3 FrancisFrancis! X3 Espresso Machine, Black Matte. I was wary of the pod idea and couldn't imagine getting real espresso from an air packed pod of really old espresso. Francis Francis had a canister to try in the package, so I broke down one day and just tried it. I must say, it was actually really good. The canister was a little old so the espresso was a little bitter but it had better cr&egrave;me and consistency of most any of my pulls. The Francis Francis machines are made for pods so I just put the little guy in and turned on the machine. Clean-up was easy, just pull the side paper and throw it away. I didn't have to wipe-up espresso dust off everywhere, clean espresso off the machine nothing really. Not to mention the price of these little things is much better than having to pay for ok/horrible espresso close to home or pay outrageous amounts for shipping. Also, Lilly makes many different varieties of espresso like medium (I left this same review for that variety), dark, decaf, etc. (not sure about other brands, I've just stuck with Lilly) So, in conclusion, I've converted  I'm a closet pod user and the ease of use and the fact that I can get 36 pods for less than a dollar a piece is great for me."
386455,B001E5DYTY,CLM,weak,I thought i was saving a bit of $ per pod by purchasing the Illy brand for my new Delonghi machine.  Espresso was weak compared to Starbucks.  I use 2 per large Latte with the Illy and one from Starbucks to make the same size.  Not much of a savings this way.  Would not purchase again.
386456,B001E5DYTY,"Brockeim ""Playful Literary Adventurer""",Not Up to illy's High Standard,"I am disappointed. They work as advertised: quick, clean, and easy. However, more important to me is taste. While individually wrapped, the freshness of beans ground just for that moment is missing. The pod itself uses less coffee than I would in a single shot. Since I more often will make lungos, the sheer lack of coffee volume produces a weaker drink. Instead of pulling twice as long, I pull it 80% as long for a short shot, but it takes longer to get it all into the cup. The crema is impressive, equal to any regular Illy. The cost-per-drink is poor. I already knew this, but hoped I would be impressed enough by the quality so as to tolerate the price. I regular buy cans of illy's dark roast whole beans for grinding into espresso. These ESEs are not as good as the real thing. Because of the high standard illy otherwise supports for its products, I cannot give my full support to the illy Caffe Scura Coffee, Espresso, (Dark Roast, Black Band), 18-Count E.S.E. Pods. --Brockeim"
386457,B001E5DYTY,D. Sheppard-Brick,Great ESE pods.,"I'm pretty particular about my expresso and I much prefer fresh ground to the pods. But fresh ground is messy and takes more time. I have tried a bunch of different pods on the market. These are by far the best I've had. They give a rich bold flavor that's still smooth and enjoyable. Compared to the Starbucks pods these are one star above at least. They are a bit more expensive, but after going back and forth between these, the starbucks ones, and a few other brands the price difference per pod is usually no more the $0.20. In my opinion it is well worth the extra $0.20 for a delicious cup of expresso. Often better even then what I get at various coffee shops. If your an every day espresso/latte/cappuccino drinker then you will appreciate the subtle yet noticeable higher quality of these pods."

Which actually suprised me. illy pods take about half the time Starbucks pods take, I think this is because the grounds are not as tightly packed. With illy and Lavazza I have had a couple pods break, or water leak out of my machine, found out it was due to the extra little grip lip on the pod itself so after I cut those off no more leaking.

After going through the 2 boxes I can say it does taste good, but I still prefer fresh ground. It is hard to explain, but these pods had a distinct taste, not like the fresh ground I make or what you would expect at Starbucks.

Stands up well in the the steamed milk. Price-wise, I save a bit vs. stopping for a grande Starbucks latte and get a much better flavor. One tip: I read this in another review, and I'll confirm that dampening the pod before use works well for me for the best seal and pull.

Given the price, I expected these to be very good, but was unimpressed.  The taste is not significantly less bitter than Starbucks, and the aroma less appetizing.

I think this is an excellent company, the olives are meaty and attractive, but I don't like olives with a bunch of dried herbs flavoring them. To their credit, that flavor is not as heavy handed as some. Oregano just seems to get stronger and stronger, and to me, very objectionable. I'm going to get some more Ionian Greens - unflavored, straight up olives. I'm sure there's room in the refrigerator for 10 pounds of olives ."
386486,B000FAIRBO,Valerie Driscoll,VDriscoll,"This is a product that I buy 5 jars at a time at my local grocers.  It costs much less to buy in bulk and the product is of equal quality.  One word of caution, have a plan for storage as the bag is not resealable."
386487,B000FAIRBO,Rap,Never again,"If you are ever tempted to buy Peloponnese country olives because Byzantine country olives are not available, I have a word of advice: don't. In fact, I would say more generally, don't ever. The problem for me is twofold. One, they are mushy, never firm. Two, they are in a briny water that is heavily flavored with herbs, primarily oregano I think, which gives them a very salty, pungent and unpleasant taste. What is worse is that they all taste the same, when they are supposed to be a mix. I would never buy them again."
386488,B000FAIRBO,Karen Delgrosso,Good Olives,"We have purchased these many times, & also sent them as gifts. They are very tasty but now that the price has gone sky high we will be savoring our last bag.  (UPDATE) Ordered these for xmas 2010 despite the price increase & they were terrible, soggy to the point of being almost rotten. I won't ever buy these again, such a shame, when they were good, they were very good."
386489,B000FAIRBO,Careful Shopper,Nice variety and good price for olives,"This is a very good assortment( some large, some small, some black, some green). Our shipment arrived with minimal damage to the olives.  The taste is good.  We drain the olives add a pierced jalapeno pepper or two to a jar and then fill to completely cover the olives with good quality olive oil.  Olives prepared this way are not refrigerated and will keep for months. Just place them on your counter top away from direct sunlight or in the pantry and enjoy. After the olives are gone you can use the flavored olive oil for cooking.  This is a particularly good value when you sign up for a regular subscription ( comes to about $6/ per pound).  We eat lots of olives so this is a good deal for us. I also find a jar of olives to be a good hostess gift for friends."
386490,B000FAIRBO,A. Ash,"If you like whole olives, I recommend these.","These olives are a blend of Kalamata, Ionian Green and other types.  The quality is fine and they taste great.  The blend is typical of those found in olive bars in supermarkets like Wegmans in the NE but at about 2/3rds the cost.  If you are looking for mixed whole Greek olives and can use 5 lbs within 1 months time from opening,this is the best deal you are likely to find."

I have a 4 year old pug who loves anything rawhide but has some allergy problems, so I've been trying out other products to see what can fit her needs. She is currently gnawing on the last of the 3 chews that came in the pack I bought (all this flavor) - the ""soup bones"" smell pretty tasty, and she appears to love them, but my chief complaint is that these bones are supposedly ""long lasting"". I gave my pug the soup bone 1 minute before I started typing, and without taking any breaks from where I am currently typing at (about 2 minutes into this review), the bone is 3/4 gone. Knowing her, and the noises I'm hearing, she's demolishing that last quarter, putting it at roughly a 4 minute treat. To me, that is not very lengthy of time. TL;DR: This product will last roughly 4 minutes in the mouth of any dog that has ever had more than 25 rawhides in their life; probably tastes good, no splintering (as promised)."

386501,B001E5DYTO,"Paul DeZan ""paul55764""",Just try it,"Many vocal critics of illy coffee have never actually tasted it. As Dr. House says, everybody lies and illy is apparently a very popular thing to lie about. I've caught several vocal critics lying about illy (by serving it to them, getting the typical ""This is fabulous!"" reaction, then telling them what they're drinking. You know, the Folger's Coffee Crystals technique). Why is this? Well, on the surface illy does appear to be frivolous and therefore an easy target. - It's very expensive, especially for coffee that comes in a can  - It's got a very fussy, very European marketing envelope around it  - It tends to be sold in fussy, trendy stores  - Because it's roasted and packaged in Italy, it is always several months old when you buy it  - Did I mention that it's very expensive? As a result, it's easy to dismiss illy as an elitist, ""image"" product that can't possibly be worth what it costs. And it's easy to convince others of the same thing, whether you've actually tried illy or not. The truth is illy is really superb coffee, just about the best I've ever tried. Since I've started drinking it at home, I've found I'm actually drinking much less coffee overall, because I only know a couple of places that serve illy locally and I just don't feel like bothering with anything else, at least most of the time. The ironic net effect of this is that illy may actually be saving me some money! I don't know if illy will be worth what it costs to you. There are some very good coffee beans sold by Costco for roughly 1/5 the price, much better than anything you can get at Starbucks or Peets. (In fact, if Starbucks or Peets is your idea of really good coffee, stop reading this now. Not because I think you're some tasteless boob, but because those brands are in the very modern, very successful mode of bitter, over-roasted, burned-tasting American coffee and I don't personally care for that. So if you like those brands, you're probably not going to like illy or any coffee that I like. Personally, I like the bottomless cup of Peerless my favorite diner serves much better than Starbucks.) What I do know is that if you like coffee enough to own a decent grinder and other caffeine paraphernalia, you really ought to try illy. In particular, if you like light-medium roasts but find most are just too wimpy, you may just love this stuff. If not, you'll at least have a cute, fussy  little can you can sub-divide some of your Costco walnuts into. And that is something."
386502,B001E5DYTO,Petur O. Jonsson,consistent high quality,"Illy espresso beans are my favorite of all the widely available commercially produced roasted espresso beans. This is the standard medium roast that Illy produces and it is a bit less aggressive and milder tasting than the dark roasts of Lavazza (the other major Italian brand that some people favor). When properly ground, tamped, and brewed Illy espresso has a delightful aroma and flavor, unmatched by any of the other brands. Granted, Illy is quite pricey, and I do not use it all the time for this reason. However, you get what you pay for. Usually, I buy my espresso from a small roasting house in the Midwest that produces a decent medium roast substitute that I do not mind using most of the time. But Illy definitely produces a higher quality bean. One way to judge the quality of roasted espresso beans even before you taste the coffee that they will produce is to look at the evenness of color and size of the beans. The reason is that beans of a uniform size tend to roast more evenly than beans of varying sizes. Moreover, even when the beans are of a uniform size, it is important that they be roasted in small batches and churned during the the entire roasting process to ensure that they all get roasted to the same point. This is why most high quality coffee is roasted in small batches in a rotating drum that roasts all the beans to the exact same point. Moreover, since the moisture content of the beans varies a bit from batch to batch, quality control in the roasting process is extremely important. And it is here that Illy is unmatched. Just do a simple visual comparison of the color and consisteny of Illy beans when compared to any of the other widely available brands and you can easily see why Illy is the best."

The reason for 3 stars is the price. I find Lavazza Tierra which %100 Arabica like Illy has the same quality or better for a fraction of the price of Illy beans.
386504,B001E5DYTO,Riyad Kalla,Best vacuum-sealed beans if you can't get fresher,"My adventure with coffee started years ago; I've been through a Jura-Capresso S9 (Super-automatic) and eventually found my way to a Rancillio Silvia V3 espresso machine. My hunt for good beans (Tucson, AZ) has been as variable, eventually being able to find decent fresh-ish beans at the local Whole Foods-type-place (Sunflower). Of all the mail-order, vacuum-sealed, ""older"" beans I've tried (including any main-stream beans like Milestone) from a super market, these Illy are much better, but compared to real, fresh beans, they don't quite stand up. Taste-wise these beans are much smoother than I expected; because they are vacuum-sealed and typically 2-4months old by the time you get them, I expected the dry/sharp/bitter taste that I get from every other bean I've tried (you ever tried Starbucks beans? Good lord, bitter) and was surprised when they actually ended up being quite a bit smoother. The smell during grinding is a typical ""dry/old"" bean smell, it doesn't have that lustrous smell that a fresh bean does and when pulling the shot it doesn't have that carmel-colored, never-ending crema that a fresh bean gives, but surprisingly enough, it tastes pretty nice. At my Whole Foods-esque store, I can get fresh-ish beans for $7.99/lb, at roughly $36/lb it is *impossible* for me to justify these Illy beans. If you are in a location where fresh-beans are an impossibility and you have been relegated to super-market, main-stream garbage beans, and you don't mind paying the premium, these beans are quite nice and should keep you pretty happy. If you are a bean-snob and demand perfect behavior of your beans through the grind/shot sequence, then you probably need to keep looking and need to move somewhere where fresh coffee is more readily found :)"
386505,B001E5DYTO,Michael A. Dominy,Way better than Starbucks,"I've been drinking espresso since 1983 when I was introduced to it by Signor Forza in Rome. I found out that Italians have a saying ""Only women and babies drink cappucino after 9:00"". What that means is that all the men take a coffee (espresso) break at 9:00. Well since I returned to the states in 1985 I have tried all kinds of expresso beans, using mostly Starbucks. I happened across a can of Illy beans at a Tucson store. I vaguely remembered the Illy brand from my 8 months in Italy and decided to try it. It is inarguably the best espresso I have had since returning from Italy."

I don't drink it every day because it is a bit pricey, but whenever I have guests, I serve them illy it is nice to let them feel special that I am sharing this treat with them.

386507,B001E5DYTO,Aaron Dupont,Simply great coffe beans!!!!,"I have had esspresso from here to china in many different shops.  I know my coffee and espresso.  As coffee is a very personal prefrence take this for what it may.  There is no bitterness (though some skill is needed in making it) the flavor is rich, smooth, and consistent.  that is where illy is a step ahead of others.  Notice the consistent bean size in an Illy can.  this leads to constent roasting of the beans.  This leads to constent flavor.  Weather you prefer a dark roast or a medium the bean size uniformity is key to the roasting and processing steps of the process.  a good analogy is does angel hair pasta need to boil for as long as a thick ziti.  No if you did the angel hair would be mush by the time the ziti was done.  Well cofee beans can be over or under done for the same reason thickness and size drive rates. One thing I would say to some one concered about the price.  For 16 dollars I get a week of espresso's.  I used to spend this in D&D or starbuck in 2 days, and it was not as good! If you really enjoy your coffee you should give it a try, if you still really like starbucks after that I would be shocked!!!  It would be a challange for me to go to starbucks again unless I am in an airport and no where serves Illy! For me it is well worth it"

The beans are good, flavor decent, rarely bitter but didn't find anything truly special about the coffee. Bought a can of Kicking Horse 454 to compare. The beans are very oily and aroma far more overpowering than the Illy. It may be too strong but it was clear that these beans were very fresh and full bodied. While 454 is a dark roast, even the medium roasts seem to have the same experience. One of my friends called Illy ""airport coffee"" and while I think it's a cut above the cheap, I'm not sure I disagree with him. I certainly think Peet's is better than Illy. Perhaps it's meant for espresso machines, I don't know. But at this price, I don't think it's worth it. Everything is a matter of taste, of course, but if you get a chance to look at the beans from other brands, you might be surprised. I certainly was."

Instead of trying to describe its qualities, let me relate a story: This summer we went on a houseboat vacation where I was subjected to God-awful drip coffee for a week.  As soon as we got off the boat I hit up a  Starbucks, which was of course disappointing.  Then, when I got home, we were out of Illy. On Monday morning I tried to make my espresso with some of Trader Joe's Espresso Blend, and while I love the Trader's, their espresso is horrible.  Finally at lunchtime I was able to find some Illy.  I was so thrilled that on the way home from work I had to pop the top, just to smell its deliciousness.  When I finally got home and pulled myself a shot, I was in heaven. It's like an addiction, a craving.  And in 6 months of searching since I got my espresso machine, I haven't found better nationally available coffee."

386538,B001E5DYTE,Kloomnik,Nonpareil,"I've been brewing espresso at home for over 25 years, and have tried just about everything (including lugging suitcases full of coffee from Italy).  This coffee is indeed superior to everything else.  What's interesting is that the coffee is ground perfectly for espresso machines, so I'm saved the chore and mess of grinding my own. For some reason, the chief competitor, Lavazza, although selling decent coffee, for less than half the price, does not grind it optimally, forcing me to buy their beans and grind them myself.  Illy is expensive, at least double the runner-up. But then you could argue, that 45 cents a cup, instead of 20 cents, amounts to less than a dollar per day difference (assuming 4 cups per day), an amount you could afford spoiling yourself. Unfortunately, Amazon's price is even higher than our local supermarkets (Safeway, Giant, etc) where it's sold for $12.99 a can.  You could save 15% by subscribing, but then you could stock up locally when it's on sale."

386540,B001E5DYTE,S. Hodge,The perfect cup of espresso to jump start your day  ,"After purchasing a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001KO9S8"">Gaggia 16103 Evolution Espresso Machine, Silver</a> several years ago, I started hunting for the perfect Italian espresso roast. One of my first (and favorite) blends was the Illy Fine Grind Dark Roast. Imported from Italy, Illy is available in whole beans, drip grind (for regular coffeemakers), espresso grind, and pods. When I took the Illy for a test drive, it produced an espresso with an assertive crema, something that cheaper brands such as Alessi and Lavazza did not. The beans themselves are roasted to perfection, with a caramel-like odor and nuance of flavor that I've yet to match in cheaper blends. I don't consume espresso straight, but instead whip up divine lattes using Illy Fine Grind Dark Roast as the base, although the Illy has so many rich notes, it would probably be great solo. I live in a large metro area, so there are numerous stores that carry Illy, but if you live in a small town, you may have to mail order yours. Another plus is the fact that it comes in an airtight tin perfect for storing in the freezer (as ground coffee tends to go stale quickly). Yes, this is expensive, but still cheaper than purchasing a burr grinder to grind my own espresso beans (when I pondered buying whole Illy beans and priced a burr grinder, my estimates were between $150-400). Illy also makes a fabulous decaf blend in dark roast (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007M3E86"">ILLY Ground Decaf Coffee 00493</a>) that runs several dollars more, but is perfect for those late-night espresso indulgences. If you're thinking that it's too expensive, consider that a venti latte at Starbucks will set you back about $5 for ONE coffee, versus at least a dozen from a can of really great Italian coffee."
386541,B001E5DYTE,fred,Probably the best between commercial ones,"I want to review this product because I think there are some misunderstanding on what you should expect from it. First thing: Illy is one of the most appreciated brands in Italy, between those you find in supermarket shelves. Definitely not THE BEST, since in my country you can easily have imported beans roasted and ground at the moment.  Second: It is NOT for use in auto dripping machines. The type of grinding is too thin. American coffee is made with coarse grind. This is to be used with espresso machines, or ""caffettiera"", amongst which Bialetti is the best brand, or pressure steam machines, those you find at the coffe shops.  Third: to all of you who say ""it's bitter"": just put sugar in it, in Italy we put sugar in espresso. If you don't use sugar it is SUPPOSED to be bitter. To all of you who say it doesn't give you the ""caffeine shot"": that's not what espresso is for. If you need caffeine and need to wake up drink one of those energy drinks you can find at every store across the USA. Or just take some day off, sleep more and work less, like we do in Italy. Espresso is something small and enjoyable that makes your life a little better. Therefore it has to be good. It's part of our culture to enjoy the small things and try to live happier."
386542,B001E5DYTE,I Love Greek,Try your local grocer for a better price,"Marvelous coffee with a smooth, rich flavor and no bitter taste when made with an Alessi Richard Sapper stovetop machine. BUT, the price here is *way* too high. I can find this at my local grocery store for five dollars less *per can* than the price listed here, with even more savings when it's on sale."
386543,B001E5DYTE,Patricia B. Kingwell,Italy in our kitchen,"After a wonderful trip to Italy last summer, my husband and I wanted to continue having a cup of cappuccino in the afternoon. After a few experiments with some awful tasting coffees, we finally found Illy fine grind dark roast and it is perfect.It's delicious. It's an afternoon in Rome. I think I could eat the grounds by themselves! We have gotten a few friends hooked on it also and now give it as gifts. It's more expensive than what you'll find in a grocery store, but definitely worth the price, and definitely less expensive than returning to Rome every afternoon for a great cup of cappuccino."

The canister is nice, too."
386547,B001E5DYTE,B. Esser,Yummmmmmm,"I bought this at my local grocery store to use in my new Mr. Coffee espresso machine.  I'm a big coffee nut, I even roast my own coffee. I have a grinder, but at the moment it's about 400 miles away from me :P So I had to settle with this. And to be honest, it's pretty tasty! MUCH better than starsucks' best freshly ground stuff! (tells you how bad SB really is, worst coffee in the universe) But compared to my own stuff, illy coffee is downright nasty! Yes, freshly roasted, freshly ground coffee is that good!  But if you have nothing else available, or you don't want to buy a grinder, this is the best pre-ground, canned coffee money can buy! I can find it in my local grocery store for a lot cheaper than here. Under 12 bucks at the San Antonio based Texas grocery chain."

The two-pack and auto-delivery ensures I won't run out even if I don't make it to the store. The coffee is a rich, dark roast (for some reason, harder to find than medium roast--seems strange for espresso) and has the best flavor of the Italian imports I've tried."

It's a great little machine and it makes great espresso. I have tried at least 6 different kinds of espresso from the national brand where the baristas wear green aprons to most of the others. I settled on Illy because it was the first espresso made, back in the day, and it comes from Italy. The grind is very fine so you will need a basket that can hold fine espresso. If you are familiar with a burr coffee grinder, I will bet that this coffee is ground on a setting of 1. Don't talk to me about pods. Illy makes them but I like this espresso in the can. When you pop the lid, close your eyes and the aroma will take you to a bar in Italy. When you drink the resulting brew, it will have the same effect. It is the real deal and I buy it all the time."

I'd had it in restaurants and always enjoyed it, but never thought about purchasing it for my home use. I often mix it with another favorite roast and end up with the best of both worlds. It's a little more expensive than the coffee I regularly buy . The $$ spent for 2 8.8 oz. tins of Illy will buy about 2 LBS. of the other coffee I use. Illy is a luxury I won't give up soon."

386558,B001E5DYTE,Vero,Illy is my Madeleine de Proust,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYTE"">illy, Ground Espresso Coffe, Fine Grind (Dark Roast, Black Band), 8.8-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>  When I miss home, I make an illy espresso. I feel immediately better, it is my madeleine de Proust. Illy makes me feel as I were back home.  There are wonderful, rare and precious coffees on this planet; but for exactly the same reasons, these beans are also very expensive. Let's think for instance of the Kopi Luwak alias Kafe laku alias Kape alamid (depending on the country that produces it), the Bourbon, or the Blue Mountain etc. Ok, sure they are great coffees if you can afford them.  Even if we cannot compare what cannot be compared, Illy is a coffee company which makes fantastic AND affordable coffees. I like the dark ground espresso one because in Europe and especially in Italy we love strong coffee. Plus, I have no grinder. I like the foam on the top and the trace it leaves in my cup once I emptied it. And what to say about its fantastic color and smell? Illy coffee is a very good investment, above all if you love coffee and do not want to spend that much. Next time I am going to try the new espresso collection from Brazil <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006AZ7ZNO"">Illy MonoArabica Whole Bean Coffee Brazil full-bodied Coffee 8.8oz Tin</a>and you?"

386560,B001E5DYTE,H. R. Berger,DON'T BUY THIS COFFEE!,It's more expensive than most other coffees.  Once you try it you won't be able to go back.  It's that good.
386561,B001E5DYTE,I. Haynes,A different kind of Espresso,"I was a bit disappointed with Illy.  It has a great aroma, but when brewed it doesn't have a strong coffee taste or boldness.  I drink coffee to wake up in the morning and break the fog, but this coffee just doesn't pack the punch to get me going.  I really wonder what they put in this Espresso Coffee to make it so aromatic? It almost smells like Pipe tobacco mixed with rum.  All caffeine effects me differently, this espresso made my hair go limp and I just couldn't get myself in gear to do anything.  I drink espresso to help me take on the day, but Illy failed."
386562,B001E5DYTE,"Kevin Frost ""artist and computer guy""","Great coffee, but don't buy it online.","I have always loved Illy, and bought two cans at Christmas for delivery with a bunch of other Amazon orders.  I did it purely for the convenience of not having to pick up coffee to take to my holiday destination. However, I was disappointed:  one of the cans had a broken vacuum seal (all Illy cans are vacuum sealed).  Ergo, the coffee was not fresh; and since I couldn't be sure how non-fresh, I tossed it.  The other can was fine. I imagine Amazon would have honored a return, but it's not worth the time on a simple can of coffee. So I must reluctantly recommend you do not buy this product online, since there seem to be quality-control issues and returning to the vendor in that context is a net loss. The coffee itself, though, is very excellent, and I've been a loyal Illy customer for over 10 years.  This is the first vacuum-seal issue I've ever encountered."
386563,B001E5DYTE,Kasia,I expected more,"Well , I learned again to stay away from  ground coffee , for this price ?  it is not bad or bitter but thank you, that was my last time , it is not a coffee for this price believe me   I will use it for making cappuccino , because I do not like the taste of that coffee as espresso   not even the smell , maybe is not my personal taste.. but believe me i am coffee freak and I am still in love with my gourme coffee"
386564,B001E5DYTE,Chris,"Not worth the price, not even close","Personally I don't find the flavor of this coffee in any way special. Purely on volume, this is 17.6 ounces of coffee for more money than 36 ounces of a competing product. It was nice enough, but it wasn't great. It wasn't special. It's just coffee. It does come in a nice tin though, so I took the empties and refilled them with fare trade shade grown coffee. It tastes just as good, to me, and I don't have to worry about the cost of having a few cups of coffee any more. I'm sure there are some people out there who are convinced that this stuff is worth the price. But not for me. If the tins hadn't been reusable I'd have given the coffee a 2 for being overpriced and no better than other competing quality coffees."
386565,B002MVG48W,Dane Mom,Fabulously fudgey!,"It is possible to have indulgent stuff without refined sugars.  Classic Fudge is the least sweet of the fudge flavors (according to Wax Orchards) and has a rich, creamy chocolate taste.  The consistency is very much like conventional hot fudge and it takes just 15 seconds to heat a tablespoon in the microwave for pouring or drizzling. I can taste the pineapple juice in this but I like it.  If you want something that doesn't taste like it was sweetened with fruit then this may not be the best match.  I usually warm a tablespoon and toss with a sliced banana and unsweetened coconut.  Delicious! I buy Wax Orchards Classic Fudge at the local natural foods store for about half of the Amazon price.  If you are interested, it's worth shopping around."
386566,B004NNDDVI,Mr3dfx,MMMmmmmm cheesy!,"These are like their other Cheese flavored pretzel pieces, but better! These are actually full nibblers (no not the character from ""FUTURAMA"", although cute just the wrong nibbler anywhoo ). The flavor is much more smokey than the bright orange counterpart. I also like how most of the cheese is concentrated at the crack of where the pretzel separated so you can experience the flavor at your own pace.  To sum it up, for me these are an adult version of the ever popular chip that is bright orange and has a cheetah for a mascot, and they don't leave cheetle behind, although a good licking session may have to be re-visited, but I digress Buy a pack try 'em out."
386567,B004NNDDVI,TheOwner,The best snack on earth.,Quite possibly the best flavor Snyder's has to offer. Once you've had a bag you will need 5 more and will understand why Amazon sells these as a 6 pack. The only downside is that these are only available here and direct from Snyder's site.
386568,B004NNDDVI,Cody,Great and Addicting!,"These are a great snack. It's powered cheese and not as good as Cheez-it's but it definitely packs a bigger crunch and satisfies the craving in less pieces than cheez-it's or other products have. One bag will take me a week or two to finish when a similar sized box of Cheez-it's is gone in half the time. They are similar in nutritional value I'd say. If you're a Cheez-it, cheese nips or other cheese cracker fan give these a try if you're looking for something different. You will not be disappointed!"

Maybe because these golden raisins are moister and tenderer than the dark ones, the stems separate more readily in processing.

The price on Amazon is less than the ones in the supermarkets, too. We love these raisins straight out of the box, on our cereals, or in our recipes.  We have used them in some of our recipes in The Collard Patch. We buy these often and keep them handy. As grocery prices continue to grow, we are careful to give ourselves little treats like these raisins, which we consider a gourmet product -- actually fit for royalty -- to keep us content with our frugal way of life. Nutritionally they are an excellent source of dietary fiber, energy, and potassium. In 2007, we bought a box of Sun Maid California Golden Raisins that did not measure up to our standards.  Although the raisins were tasty, the box had about 20% dark raisins.  We wrote the Sun Maid Company and expressed our disappointment.  Evidently this occurrence was something they did not expect or accept.  They told us that there is no way to avoid having a few dark raisins in the box but that this box was not representative of their fine product.  And here is the wonderful part of the story:  They sent us coupons for three free boxes of raisins to make things right!  Where could you find a better deal than that?

386575,B001E53020,Matthew G. Sherwin,all right by me !!!,"Sun Maid yellow golden raisins are the best brand of yellow raisins on your grocer's shelf--period. These raisins are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too. However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They are relatively high in sugar (29 grams per 1/4 cup) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that. However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these raisins are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, the raisins do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily. These golden raisins are better than regular raisins if you wish to use a recipe that calls for cooking with raisins. These can come in handy! Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the bottom of the container. Eat or use these raisins before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh! These raisins are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Raisins provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus. Highly recommended--to life!"

I carry a bottle or two of 4oz water and a couple of packets in my purse at all times for emergencies. Paid $10.69 for a box of 16 at Target. Only 4 out of 5 stars because you can only make 4 oz or 8 oz.

386599,B003TN6ZN6,"Angela K. Webb ""A.K.W.""",Wonderful!!,"Throw a few in your diaper bag in case of emergency and you don't have to worry about space issues or worry about trying to measure out formula in preparation for a long outing.  Like others, I use this to supplement so this is also fabulous for those onesie/twosie feedings that come up when I can't nurse - without having to buy a can of powder.  I got hooked on these when they sent me samples in the mail."
386600,B003TN6ZN6,Lala,Damaged packaging,"I love this for travel and times we're out of the house for most of the day. I was, however, very disappointed when the last time I ordered this, 4 packs in one of the boxes were open."
386601,B003TN6ZN6,Nicole,love these on the go!!,quick and easy if i dont have a formula dispenser on hand! love them! i think you get like 16 to 20 in a pack (not sure) but they are awesome and very helpful!
386602,B003TN6ZN6,"Modern Dayhippy ""moderndayhippy""",Love This Product!,"I love that I don't have to tote a large can of formula around with me when out shopping, at church, at family functions, etc. I keep a bunch of these in the inside pocket of the diaper bag, grab one out when needed, rip the top off (which is very easy to open), dump formula in bottle that has already had 4 ounces of water put in it (I fill mine at home before leaving), shake, and feed. So easy it's ridiculous! Best on the go product ever!"
386603,B003TN6ZN6,L. Zhao,"as expected, yet cheaper than in the store",Has been using this single-served powder packs whenever we are on the road.  I got 3 boxes for our 1-week trip.  Just bring bottled water. Very convenient.
386604,B003TN6ZN6,Alecia,Great! Wish they were more affordable!,"These are an absolute must for momma's that are formula feeding and ever need to make a bottle while out. These easy tear packages packed in the diaper bag alongside a bottled water and empty bottle are great. I've tried packaging formula myself, to save money and it is just MESSY and ends up wasting formula that gets spilled (during packaging AND use). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the price. It's just so expensive and coupons are hard to come by for this type of enfamil product!"
386605,B003TN6ZN6,Shannon,Packaging is perfect for our situation,"My baby is breast fed but goes to daycare.  I'm no longer pumping as much as she sometimes demands.  This packaging of formula is perfect for that situation.  Any other type would go to waste since she only has maybe 4oz of formula once a week.  This is perfect for a baby that doesn't drink formula everyday and also perfect for travel, no waste and small packaging."
386606,B003TN6ZN6,Javier / Peru,Exelent !!!!!,"This is a practical product when you goes out and you are not sure if baby will requires his milk, then you need to fill the bottle with 4 oz warm water and carry the 4oz blister that is ready to use. Price agains big can portion is almost the same. The only problem is when baby eats more than 4oz."
386607,B003TN6ZN6,Sun,I always take this when I go out with my baby,"This is very convenient and whenever I go out with my baby, I always take 3-4 packets with a bottle of water.  I am planning to travel 2 months later and I will buy enough of these to take with me."
386608,B003TN6ZN6,bostonchap,"Super convenient, super expensive.","We bought this because our little one wasn't a regular formula drinker so it didn't make sense to open large tubs of it, only to throw it away.  It's a great idea but obviously you are paying for the convenience.  I've been thinking of buying a vacuum packer but wasn't sure it was going to work with powder and worth the time and effort.  Also, this stuff is great for long road trips or travel."
386609,B003TN6ZN6,MK,Very handy for travel,These are great for the diaper bag and air travel.  There is a limit to how much ready made formula you can bring through security these solved that problem (mix after security check).
386610,B003TN6ZN6,Sami,Handy when out and about,"My wife loves these because it's convenient when we're out shopping or running other errands. No carrying a big container of formula, and trying to get the measurement right in the car   we received samples like this in the mail, but couldn't find them easily except on-line."
386611,B003TN6ZN6,Mariya,Great item,"We are very happy with the purchase. This item is very convenient when we are walking with the baby on the street. Easy to open, great taste (I can see it in my baby eyes)."

Our dog loves it, and eats every bit of his breakfast, lunch and dinner right down. The breeder said for us to mix the food with a little warm water and a tablespoon of plain, unflavored, nonfat yogurt.  My vet agreed, and said that the yogurt was an excellent addition.  He also has standard poodles as his personal pets. As poodle owners know, the breed can be susceptible to a horrible stomach condition called ""bloat.""  Feeding your poodle a top grade dog food on a regular schedule is very important for these lovely animals.  This dog food fits the bill perfectly. It is interesting that this is an adult dog food, but the kibble is smallish, and if mixed with the warm water while the dog is a puppy, it can be used throughout the dog's life, once he/she is weaned.  You do not need a puppy chow when the dog is young. This seller provides this food at a fair price, and ships promptly. Recommended."

I put off buying iced tea due to the expense and thought how much different could it be from those cheep container mixes you find at the grocery store.  Boy was I wrong.  For starters my favorite ice tea is the half and half lemonade, and I find that these deliver the right amount of flavor, sweetness and that freshely brewed flavor I would expect from a Keurig brewer.  I find myself hiding my k cups from the rest of my family and complaining when the ice tray hasn't been refilled.  Keep in mind everyone's tastes are different and I tend to like my drinks sweet, I find the smaller tea cup setting on my brewer to work the best for this, without having to add additional sweetner or sugar."
386620,B007SI3WAM,"Sandra Trolinger ""trolsgirl""",Close enough to my favorite coffee shop drink to make me happy,I love going by Starbucks during the hot summer days here in Texas and ordering a shaken black tea lemonade sweetened with light ice. When I got my Keurig brewer and was checking out the drink selections for iced tea I came across this one and had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised that the taste is accurate for the ratio of tea/lemonade and the sugar was sweetened just enough. My son and I love them and he is the one that discovered that the 6 oz. water setting is best for the maximum flavor. These are a staple in my household and I love my Keurig brewer and will be saving money by drinking these at home instead of going to my local Starbucks! They are on 70 calories per serving and you get 25% of your Vitamin C intake for the day too.

Place on a cookie sheet and freeze, allow them time to freeze solid. Then place in a plastic bag and place them back in freezer, just grab what you need.  Maintain their color and look so good in the tea."
386622,B007SI3WAM,KAT,Pretty good but beware if you don't like artificial sweeteners,"This isn't bad but I can really taste the REBIANA (SWEETENER FROM STEVIA).  I dislike the taste of artificial sweeteners and didn't realize this product was artificially sweetened (though the first ingredient in the list is evaporated cane juice, so I don't know why they needed to add the Rebiana)."
386623,B007SI3WAM,"A. L. Snyder ""NotCordelia""",Celestial Half and Half lemonade tea for Keurig brewers.,"I purchased a box of 16 of these half-and-half (black tea and lemonade) k-cups at Bed, Bath & Beyond.  They had a $9.99/box sale, and it was too good to pass up--especially since my better half loves lemonade iced tea.  Sadly, it was a bit of a disappointment.  It was barely different from the ""Perfect Iced Tea -- Sweet Lemon Tea,"" and didn't have the bite of lemonade.  I wasn't expecting perfection--I realize that lemonade in any form is asking a lot from a hot beverage machine, but it was still a bit of a let down.  Also, I prefer to sweeten my drinks with Splenda.  (I don't need 13 grams of carbs from a glass of iced tea.) That said, my Keurig Limited Edition remains the best coffee machine I have owned to date, and the Coffee People ""Donut Shop"" variety is my favorite every-morning k-cup."
386624,B007SI3WAM,==ASA==,Mmmmmm .so good .,"I first tried this k-cup as a sample.  I was hesitant at first because most teas for the Keurig brewer are either bland, weak, or both.  The sample I tried came in a pack of 4 different iced tea flavors from Celestial Seasonings.  They were are suprisingly very good brewed over ice.  But, this one was by far my favorite.  It has a nice blend of ""teaness"" and lemon-y sweetness.  A pack of equal or splenda really brightens up the flavors.  I was instantly hooked and ordered a big box of this stuff on Amazon right after trying this drink. As others have mentioned, there is one big caveat to this drink.  It is a caloric drink.  So, if you are looking to restrict your caloric intake in terms of sugary beverages, becareful with this k-cup.  There isn't a whole lot of calories (about 1/2 a can of soda's worth), but it's still there and considering how good this drink is, it's hard to just drink 1.  Other than that, I think this is the best non-coffee beverage available on the Keurig brewer."

Whenever I want iced tea, it's there and doesn't require a lot of work. That being said, I wish it was a little more lemonade flavored than just lemon-ey. Sometimes if I let the drink sit a little too long it takes on pretty acidic lemon flavor that isn't all that pleasant. I also stumbled across a sample pack of the Southern Sweet Tea flavor since ordering this product and I've enjoyed it much more. This flavor is a good try by Celestial Seasonings but it still needs a little work."

Weak and flavorless and is the best I can say about this. You get neither a good tea taste nor a lemonade taste.  You do seem to get a bit of a bitter after-taste though. This may be due to  how much the ice cubes melt during production.  Frankly it is easier and less expensive to have a gallon of a good brand pre-made combination drink on hand. Brewed on 8 ounce setting as per manufacturers recommendation. *SAMPLE PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER*"

Out of all the teas and coffees I have, this one always runs out first."
386634,B007SI3WAM,Suzukijack,Daily ritual now!,"After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about this iced tea.  Being an ""Arnold Palmer"" fan, I used to make my own at home.  A pot of brewed tea and store bought lemonade.  It was great, but it took some too time to make, and the store lemonade had a lot of sugar.  So, needless to say, when I got this, I immediately made a cup.  I found that the 6oz. setting was the best.  Everyone that has tried it, has really liked it, even the pickiest of my friends and family members.  I don't know what the ""chemical"" taste that some reviews are talking about, nor the fake sugar taste.  I like the fact that it's real tea, and that the lemonade side isn't too overpowering. I drink this probably at least twice a day now, and will keep it stocked in my Keurig pod holder!"

I decided to give it a try anyway, and I was surprisingly pleased with it. I will say that I think it needs to be sweeter (so I add some stevia or splenda), but otherwise I think it is pretty good.

The rich dark chocolate flavor is quite noticeable in these dense snack bars, which also contain 6 grams of protein and a whopping 9 grams of fiber (that's 36% of the RDA) per serving. These nutritional benefits somewhat offset the fact that saturated fat accounts for more than half of the fat content per serving (2 of the 3.5 fat grams per serving).

I have prime but I realize that not everyone does so if you factor in another couple bucks for shipping ridiculous price. I'm not sure how much a box of this costs in stores (considerably less I would hope) but I daresay that it is unlikely that the price is worth the product. If anyone could use a good diet bar it's me but the problem with diet bars is in the name. They are DIET bars. They aren't supposed to taste great (otherwise you'd be in danger of eating the whole box and what kind of diet is that) so instead they usually taste like a mix of cardboard and well more cardboard. Now the South Beach Diet Bar Granola Bar isn't THAT awful. Don't take that delicious looking beast on the package for truth. The real product is much flatter And the taste? Well it tastes exactly what you would think a chocolate diet bar would taste like. It's unfair for me to bash a diet bar based on taste after admitting that diet bars aren't SUPPOSED to taste good but that image on the package really got my hopes up. But how effective is the bar? Effective enough. I ate one this morning and I didn't eat again till later this evening. That's not really praise for the diet bar, I have a pretty hectic schedule. But maybe I didn't notice the hunger as much. I'm guessing I could eat a granola bar (get better taste at a cheaper price) and be the same level as hungry. So if you take diets/diet bars seriously then this might be the bar for you. It doesn't really have anything to separate it from the other snack bars out there other than the South Beach name but hey, what do I know?"

Don't expect it to taste like candy - this is a granola bar, after all - but it does offer a rare treat for those trying to lose weight.  While the heavier fiber intake may make it a little bit of an acquired taste, the chocolate makes it a lot easier to acquire.  If the rest of losing weight could only be this easy!"

I think the most important aspect of any diet product, if it's palatable and these are, is whether or not they're filling. These do fill the void, but with so much fiber you can expect a gassy side effect. They're kind of like drinking Slim Fast which many people refer to as gas in a can, but that's the sacrifice we dieters have to make to lose weight. They're great if you get up late and cannot wait to cook a plate!"

I have successfully used the South Beach Diet over the past few years both to loose weight and to improve my cholesterol and I have incorporated its principles into the way that I eat all year long.

386666,B0012AQN8U,mindy,Healthier than Whole Wheat alone and taste even better,"I love the tastes of this pasta. It tastes even better than just 100% whole wheat. Kamut is a wheat type of grain but for what I have read has more micro nutrients (more healthy) and most of person that are gluten intolerant can eat Kamut with no problem. And Buckwheat is pretty nutritious (Whole grain buckwheat is an amazingly nutritious food. Even though it's protein is relatively low at approximately 11%, the protein buckwheat does have contains the eight essential amino acids and is one of the few ""grains"" (remember that buckwheat isn't a grain at all is more like a fruit) high in lysine. If you use half buckwheat flour with your wheat flour, the buckwheat's amino acids will round out the limiting amino acids in your wheat nicely, giving you a nearly perfect balance of the 8 essential amino acids. This particular balance between half wheat and half buckwheat flour is much more closely aligned to your dietary needs even than lean beef!!! It's also rich in many of the B vitamins as well as the minerals; phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper and manganese. In addition to this, it's a good oil source of Linoleic acid, one of the two essential fatty acids we must have to be healthy. Nutritionally speaking, buckwheat is a truly impressive food. Taken from [ ]. Even though, it said that is organic, it doesn't contain any known certification like (USDA) to prove it, so if you looking for an organic strictly food, you would have to take a leap of faith here. So in conclusion, if you are looking for getting a better (in healthy and tastes) to whole wheat this is a pretty good product."
386667,B0012AQN8U,Lyn Watson,Great tasting and very high in fiber,"I love all of Eden's products I have bought and I have bought many. They have quality in every package. This item is something I bought thinking it was gluten free, but after reading more info on Kamut via the internet, I don't think it is. Thankfully I am not gluten intolerant, simply wheat sensitive. This product does not seem to have the same affect on my body as regular wheat. It is high in fiber (5g) per serving for pasta and 9g of protein (Unheard of in pasta), plus high in phosphorus and magnesium (both 20% of the recommended daily requirements). My boyfriend who is a huge bread and pasta lover said this tasted just like the real thing served with spagetti sauce - we did not try it alone with butter."

It could have a richer milk chocolate flavor, and be a bit sweeter and a little silkier.  That said, it doesn't taste bad, and certainly doesn't keep me from enjoying the candy! My very favorite s-f caramels are JUDY'S, but if I can't get those, then these Russell Stover's run a close second. I've avoided all artificial sweeteners for YEARS, only rarely have had regular candy during that time, and until recently didn't do any sort of sugar-free.  Lately I have been really missing nice caramels, and as I need to keep a close eye on the carbs, I've made an exception with this candy being artificially sweetened.

I read that the sweetener erythritol had low glycemic impact, but none of the accompanying health problems, but still felt a bit nervous. All of the current dietary suggestions include a bit of dark chocolate for its antioxident benefits, so I decided to give these bars a try. I am very pleased with the taste of the chocolate. It is very rich and satisfying. No problems with digestion, even when I went a bit overboard with quantity! The erythritol does have a mild ""cooling"" effect as it melts in your mouth, but I rather liked the effect. Like powdered sugar melting in your mouth, or the coolness of mint without the mint flavor. The almonds (also on many 10 ten food lists of dieticians) are a wonderful addition. I wish it was not so expensive, but I am going to try to limit myself to a piece or two a day for good health and happiness and hope that more competitors enter the erythritol sweetened chocolate market and help drive down the price a bit.

I like the ingredients a lot and it is hard to find candy like this that you can eat with no guilt and still actually like the taste.  So far no stomach issues either, it is sweetened with eyrithrotol (spelled wrong I know) and there is almost no other sugar free candy I can find  that is, and most of the other sweeteners used in SF candy do NOT agree with me causing a lot of stomach pain. I'd recommend trying to find one to test before buying a case of something this expensive though - even ask your local health type store if they'll order a case and sell them one by one or something."

386744,B00021639Y,GF baker,Wow! Incredible product!,"If you bake for someone who is gluten intolerant and get a little discouraged with the ""gritty"" consistency of your baking, you must try this flour! I received mine today and mixed up a batch of Wendy Wark's GF flour blend, using the superfine brown rice flour for both the brown and white rice flour called for in the recipe. I then made a batch of chocolate chip cookies. Let me first say, I am a gluten eater, my husband is the one that needs to eat GF. So I have had wheat based homemade cookies very recently. I have been trying new GF recipes for him during the 2 years since his diagnosis, trying to get as close to what he was used to as possible. This is the first time that even the raw cookie dough tasted like wheat based CC cookie dough! The cookies baked up beautifully and looked like regular. The taste and ""mouth feel"" was nothing short of miraculous. These did not elicit a response of ""they're fine"" but rather, ""These are great!"" When my kids came home from school, they saw cookies and had a couple. When I told them they were GF and I had made them for Daddy, they didn't believe me. I think I will have to make some more very soon as the ones I made today are almost all gone, thanks to my husband and the kids! I now have a flour that has given me that ""perfect"" GF CC cookie recipe to file alongside the ""perfect"" GF brownie recipe and the ""perfect"" GF pizza recipe. Maybe I will have to tackle bagels next? I only hope a store near me starts to carry this or I will go broke on S&H! But I will gladly pay the S&H to have this product available to me! I can't wait to try it in other recipes."
386745,B00021639Y,Faith Pavkovich,a must have gluten-free pantry staple,I use this flour exclusively for my flour blends that call for brown rice flour.  Superfine is a true adjective for this product.  It makes all of my baked goods indistinguishable from their wheat counterparts.
386746,B00021639Y,Michael C. Barbant,Superfine Indeed!,"Say bye bye to gritty GF flour!  I bought Authentic Foods Superfine Brown Rice Flour based on the suggestion from a stellar book called Gluten Free Baking Classics by Annalise Roberts.  Her recipes call for a blend of Brown rice flour, Potato Starch(not flour), and Tapioca flour and all my recipes come out perfectly.  I supplied all the desserts for Easter and everyone raved about how GF baked goods are better that the original.  Well they hadn't tasted the trial and errors of previous mixes and flours.  So buy Authentic Foods Superfine Brown Rice Flour and The Gluten Free Baking Classics by Annalise Roberts and no one will ever know you've baked GF unless you tell them.  P. S. I even received a call from my ""Simon Cowell"" friend the next day saying he couldn't stop eating the left-overs."
386747,B00021639Y,"C. Ziegel ""DBMamaZ""",Great but . . shipping . .,"I also bought this flour based on a recomendation from the book Gluten Free Baking Basics, which i bought from this site (and love!).  It is true that this rice flour is the best quality rice flour I've used yet - however, for me the shipping cost as much as the flour, which i found hard to live with.  You can get white rice flour at an asian market, much cheaper, and also a fine ground.  However, the texture when using the asian white rice flour is a bit gummier - this brown rice flour has a much better texture.  I'm only rating at 4 stars due to the craziness of having to ship flour."

This one is non-gritty, and does not have an offensive smell.  We love and can not live without this flour! Annalise Roberts suggests this flour in her cookbooks. Buy one of her books, they are reasonable and you'll be thrilled.  You might even cry a little! Her bake goods taste normal!"
386750,B00021639Y,DedBoy,Shipping,"It seems everyone agrees that this is a great product.  The shipping is absurd. Since I can't quote prices I will simply say that if you buy this alone, as the number of bags goes up, the price of shipping per bag goes down. I plan on buying in bulk."

386752,B00021639Y,mndy2003,Much better then normal brown rice flour,I was really discouraged with the gritty texture of gluten free baking.  This flour creates a texture that is almost identical to normal flour in baked goods.  Thank goodness!
386753,B00021639Y,Vianne,Must Have For GF Baked Goods!,"Yes, shipping is ridiculous - but if you want to make the cakes, cookies, lemon bars to die for, etc., from Gluten Free Baking Classics, you have to have this flour.  There is no substitute.  I make the lemon bars all the time - they are constantly requested by my non gf family.  You don't need this flour if you make the breads from GFBC, only the sweets, but who wants to go through life without the sweets? There is little difference between buying it from Amazon and buying it directly from Authentic Foods - I think Authentic Foods direct was a few pennies cheaper.  Suck it up, count the shipping as part of the cost of the flour, swallow hard, and never look back "
386754,B00021639Y,Merianm,Best brown rice flour!,"The extra fine grind of this flour and their white rice flour allows cooks to create wonderfully textured baked goods.

Out of the 3 I would say this is my least favorite though. The flavor I most dislike is the almost clear colored one (which I believe is mango.  All the rest are pretty good, although I think peach tastes a little different than the ""Mixed"", perhaps because of the ""smoothie"" (or cream) flavor added. I look forward to trying the other two kinds-- ""wild berry"", and ""sport"". If you're new to this brand, I recommend you try some of their other flavors before this one. EDIT:  I just received the ""wild berry"" today, and I must say, it's my favorite flavor pack to date!  If you can find them for a good deal, don't hesitate to scoop it up!"

The combination of sea salt and garlic compliments just about every food we prepare. As the label says, it is ""Great on chicken, steak, burgers, fish, pasta, soups, eggs and vegetables."" It also rocks in soups, dips, some salads and sauces too. The convenience of having these two indispensable spices in one package saves time in the long run as well. The plastic mill is easy to use; just give it a few shakes, remove the cap and grind away. Ours lasts us up to six months. If you live in a humid climate like I do, the contents can start to stick a little, but I find a few sharp taps on the counter and some vigorous shaking loosens things right up. Salt and garlic lovers, look no further!"

386775,B000LKU086,"Tara Finlay ""bytara""",The Best Gluten Free Blondies,"When I found out I had to go gluten free, the first thing that came to my mind was, ""What about Blondies???""  My grandmother taught me how to make them 25 years ago. I couldn't imagine never eating them again and I didn't think it would be possible to reproduce them. On a whim, I bought a pack of Namaste Gluten-Free Blondie Mix at my local natural food store. I was delighted to see that one package makes either one 9x13 pan or 2 8x8 pans and that I didn't have to make both 8x8 pans at the same time. The minute I got home, I measured out the ingredients and in 30 minutes (plus cooling time) I had perfect blondies almost exactly like my Grandmother's. My husband loved them even more than Grandma's because they are a bit softer and more cake-like (due to using oil, not butter, I presume.) Two days later, he was asking for more blondies, so I poured the rest of the mix into a bowl and mixed them up. Total disaster. They were wet and under-cooked. I was pretty disappointed. I checked the package to make sure I added the right amount of egg, oil and water. Check. I also had originally scooped out the first batch's dry mix very loosely as the package indicated I should. But it was obvious that the ratio was off.  Back to the natural food store- bought two more packages! Today, I got out the digital food scale and weighed the mix. (Make sure you understand how to use the scale- you have to be sure that you are taking into account the weight of the container you are using.) I divided it exactly in half by weight, then measured them out again and was pretty confident I had an exact split. The batch just came out of the oven and is even more perfect than the original one. I am confident the next batch from the same bag will be perfect. ***I added a scant 1/3 cup of very loose dark brown sugar to the mix both times (after weighing) because I knew it wouldn't be sweet enough for my husband. I also added a little extra bit of salt. The first batch I made, I added a splash of good vanilla extract to, but I forgot it this time. I also added 1/3 or so of a package of Ghiradelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate baking chips. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005Z7SPU"">Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips, 11.5 oz.</a> Once I test out the second half of this mix successfully, I'll be ordering a case. I am confident I can maintain a gluten-free diet if I can have my favorite snack and these blondies fit the bill."

The day it came I made a batch.  They are VERY good, & for the gluten sensitive, & maybe can't have chocolate, these are just heavenly, & very easy to prepare.  They freeze well (& for the desperate, can be eaten that way too!).  They also cost less buying them this way, as the store price for similar products is over $2 more each."

386779,B004UOA23M,Mindless Consumer,Excellent Buy,"This coffee is an excellent buy.  I only use it for making lattes with my Rancilio Silvia, so I cannot comment on whether the bean makes good drip coffee. As a point of comparison, the beans are way better than Starbucks decaf espresso, and somewhat better than the well-advertised Lavazza beans.  The Coffee Bean Direct beans are not quite as good as Caffe Umbria Mezzanotte Decaf Blend.  Nevertheless, considering the incredible price difference between Coffee Bean Direct and Caffe Umbria, Coffee Bean Direct is a great choice. To be clear, I am not saying that you have to settle on flavor - the coffee is fantastic. Most people who have tried the lattes I make with the Coffee Bean Direct beans with the Silvia and the Rocky grinder cannot believe how great the coffee is or that it is decaf.  Like the other reviewers said, the grind is very important in order to get the great flavor and crema.  So if you are initially disappointed, experiment with your grind, dose, tamp, etc. until you get a great shot. I freeze the beans in air-tight plastic bags, and only take out small amounts of beans at a time.  I remove any air in the bag before returning the bag to the freezer.  If I don't, then the coffee becomes bitter/sour.  I average a couple of lattes a day, and a single bag lasts about 3 months."
386780,B004UOA23M,C Margolis,Coffee Bean Direct Decaf Espresso Beans,"We've started buying this product from Amazon about a year ago and the quality and value is so good that we started a subscription program (bit tricky to determine your needs for the first few months - but you can easily modify this as you learn).  Love this bean - great taste and always fresh - we mix it with a regular espresso bean to cut back on the ""jolt"" a bit. Highly Recommended!!"
386781,B004UOA23M,Comdet,"Nice, rich flavor","I normally go for medium roasts for espresso since I drink it straight, and the dark roasts tend to have a burnt undertone that can range from unpleasant to downright nasty. This roast from Coffee Bean Direct is the exception, however. The flavor is rich with smokey tones, but no (or very little) burned flavor. Excellent crema as well. While I can't say for sure since I don't like milk in my coffee, I imagine the flavor would stand up very well in a milk-based drink. I did try it as an Americano, and it was quite good. The flavors were toned down a bit as you would expect, but still came through nicely. I did have to fiddle with the grind level a bit to get a decent shot. The setting I use for medium roast beans nearly choked my espresso machine - took nearly 50 seconds for a double shot and, as you can imagine, was quite horrible. I had to go two full notches coarser on my Vario grinder to get a good shot. I expect this is due to the fact that the darker roast is much more oily than the medium roasts, and needs a coarser grind. I do wish it came in a smaller package so it would be easier to store and keep fresh. But, the five pound bag comes at an excellent per-pound price. Good beans at a good price. Highly recommend."
386782,B004UOA23M,R,Good Flavor,"It's almost as good as caffeinated espresso. Good job on the CO2 process with more flavor than water process. Smokey, slightly sweet, medium/heavy body, low acid. Very oily beans out of the bag with a rich strong smokey aroma. A good espresso bean. It had great crema, so I'm really glad I bought this. Too bad 5 pounds is going to take forever to finish by myself."
386783,B004UOA23M,GAIL ROSE,Good Coffee,Excellent coffee beans! The beans were fresh and not dried out. Beans have a lot of oil. Taste is smooth. Use it for brewed coffee.  Very nice coffee. Signed up for automatic shipments it is so good.
386784,B004UOA23M,Steve,Best tasting decaf I've had,"This is no doubt the best tasting decaf coffee that I've had.  I stopped drinking caffeinated coffee last year and have found it difficult finding good tasting decaf.  (I also try to avoid chemically decaffeinated coffee.)  The selection of decaf coffees is somewhat limited, but more significantly, I find that most decafs just don't taste too good compared to full bodied caffeinated coffees.  This is my first taste of CO2 decaf - I'm not sure what role the process plays, but Coffee Bean Direct got it right.  This coffee is full bodied, rich and great tasting.  I would definitely buy it again.  I only wish it came in a smaller sized bag."
386785,B004UOA23M,Sandy L. Warf,yummy decaf coffee,"I really like this decaf espresso! It's tasty, smooth and rich. Since I make it in a regular drip coffee pot (sorry!)and drink it black, these qualities are especially important to me. Plus, it's a great buy. I do wish it were organic. My second five pounds is already on its way!"
386786,B004UOA23M,"Clasina Gm Oneill ""Maria""",Rich and aromatic.,"I like to blend decaf with regular coffee, but I much prefer to grind the beans prior to brewing.  This decaf is very rich tasting, has a deep roasted flavor without the burned/sour aftertaste (like Starbucks coffee does).  I mix it with Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast beans.  Good buy!"
386787,B004UOA23M,Donna L.,I really tried,"I really tried with this coffee.  I tried it in a coffee maker, then I tried packing it in my espresso machine. Then I tried it in my foolproof french press, all to no avail.  No matter what I did I could not deny that every method yielded the dreaded grainy taste.  The price seemed right and so did the reviews. So Im back to taste testing again, searching for that perfect sip."
386788,B004UOA23M,bridgebuddy,Good Decaf,Another good hearty decaf from Coffee Bean Direct.  Exactly what my wife and I like.  The CO2 process seems to work well without removing all the favor.
386789,B004UOA23M,Henry A. Barrett,A good brew for a fair price,"Coffee bean direct CO2 coffee provides a good strong cup of decaf coffee, most decaf coffee's are weak or the ones that are espresso roast are expensive. This coffee is reasonably priced and has very good and rich flavor."

Back when I discovered it, I only bought one bowl to try and I was instantly hooked! But when I went back to the store to buy it again, they were out of stock, and when I tried looking for it online, it was no where to be found. I'm so excited that it's available online now! It has a great garlic and onion flavor with a delicious sesame aftertaste. It's not spicy at all, which is a great alternative to all those super hot ramen soups. Some people might be put off by some of the ingredients, (look up tonkotsu soup) but it has such an amazing flavor, that it doesn't matter. If you're into trying new things, like Japanese food and love great flavor, definitely try this one."
386799,B004HVEEW8,MyLoveIsBlind,A pleasant surprise!,"These noodles are not spicy at all, but certainly flavorful!  They have a buttery, garlic and onion flavor with a slight undertone of ginger.  My husband even liked it. (He's not a fan of spicy hot dishes nor veggies.)  They're easy to make.  Pull the label open half way, and add the flavor packets found inside.  I add hot water from my coffee maker to the line inside.  Close the label, and let it sit a while to soften the noodles. Done.  I found them at our local Asian grocery store."
386800,B004HVEEW8,"S. Ferguson ""StacyEF""",Outstanding for instant ramen,"I'll preface this review with the clarification that my five star rating is based on my opinions given the nature of the product- as a pre-packaged ramen. It's certainly no substitute for a ""real"" bowl of tonkotsu ramen. I'm a hardcore Sapporo-style ramen fan but the closest noodle shop with tonkotsu ramen is a bit out of my way and eating there requires some planning. Preparing the soup for homemade tonkotsu ramen is a long process that can take days, depending on the recipe, and I've never been motivated enough to finally try it myself from scratch because the time and effort is just too daunting for me. I dislike prepackaged ramen as a general rule, especially ramen of the ""instant"" variety that only needs the addition of boiling water and rehydration. I decided to give this product a shot since I've never had a prepackaged ramen that promised the flavor of a tonkotsu broth, which is rich and unctuous, and most instant ramen broths just resemble a clear bouillon. For a prepackaged instant ramen, I have to say that I'm really impressed with how well the flavors and texture of ""real"" tonkotsu broth are represented. No, I'd never mistake it for the real thing and if it were the real thing then I'd consider it below mediocre but for what it is, I consider it outstanding and I'll be re-ordering. Note: This is very salty (1680 mg sodium), heavy (21 g fat) and more caloric (410 calories) than most prepackaged ramen, which is already considered to be bad for you, but that's true of many ""real"" tonkotsu broths and as an occasional lunch while I'm at at work and stuck at my desk, I'm okay with that and adjust the rest of my foods that day accordingly. I wouldn't be willing to waste my sodium, fat or calorie budgets on any other instant ramen I've ever had."
386801,B004HVEEW8,"D.T. ""music_monger""","Stock your pantry w/Menraku ""Tonkotsu"" Ramen!!!","**BEGIN UPDATE 9/08** Just received my 2nd case of 12 in a little over 3-wks, but then again I've been sharing, 1/3 for sharing w/my taste-buddies while the remaining 2/3's have been for my own taste-buds.  I added little steamed won-tons today but it was more than this soup needed, maybe tomorrow a sliced hard-boiled egg; keeping it simple is the best way to enjoy this bowl of ramen wherein the broth is superior. I will let you know if I ever get on to trying the other flavors as I'd originally hoped.  Thanks for reading. **END UPDATE** If you ever enjoyed add-hot water and wait bowl-type instant ramen, this has, in my humble opinion, the best tasting broth, no-contest of this type that I've ever had since ""Cup Jorick"" came along early 70's. Fast-forward, for the last year or so I've enjoyed the ""Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Udon"" (still do!) since it isn't SPICY at all, allowing me to add spice if I choose to change it up, add steamed won-tons, char siu - you get the idea.  ""Menraku Tonkotsu Ramen"" while the noodles are on par w/instant ramen of the bowl variety, here it's the RICH BROTH, that immediately upon tasting, is set apart from the usual within the category.  Other reviewers here who have also enjoyed have picked up the same flavorful aspects:  buttery, a bit of garlic, a rich-tasting broth like you could only get home-made or in the best kept secret asian restaurants.  I look forward to trying the other Menraku varieties:  Shio Ramen, Miso Ramen, and Shoyu Ramen, all very basic flavors that can be lost causes in the wrong hands but I am convinced on this experience alone, though ""Tonkotsu"" ramen may be my new, all-time favorite, that I will enjoy the others as well.  Wondered about ""Tonkotsu""(pork-bone), not to be confused w/""tonkatsu""(breaded pork cutlet), as the broth didn't convey much pork taste though it could be usual Japanese subtlety at play here.  I got this on WED and I've had one each day since.  I should get another case soon as I know I'll be sharing.  Currently living in a dorm?  Buy the case. Stash it however you're best  able or split the case w/others. It's quick, easy and great value.  Amazon Prime got it here in two-days!!!  The only thing left to say is ""Itadakimasu!"""

When I finished my firs tin I saw that it came in bags and a box as an option as well.  I ordered the fifty pack.  The bags are good and very convenient when I travel, but no match for the satchels in flavor.  If you like a touch of cinnamon, the bags are fine.  If you want a more robust taste, I recommend the satchel."

(I feel for the one here that had the allergic response to it). So, if you really like cinnamon, (that be me), you can't do better than this for flavor, unless you chew it off the tree.  Good luck with that one.  I'm not much of a hot tea drinker except in winter.  So this summer, I made a gallon of sun tea with this and I-am-now-addicted! I use 8 or 9 bags per gallon.  If the sachets, then 6 or 7.  I like my tea strong so I leave the bottle out for as long as it takes me to remember I put it out there.  No bitterness at all.  I can always dilute the mixture if I have to.  But that's what ice cubes give up their lives for.  I'll never go back to orange pekoe again.  Take THAT, Lipton!"

Good any time of day.  Good hot or cold.  Good brewed weak or strong.  Worth every penny.  And the delivery was outstanding too.  I 've ordered it twice and it arrived really fast both times.

386817,B000PGQQFC,"Schanele ""AmazonJunkie""","Awesome, Flavorful Tea!","I absolutely LOVE this tea. The first time I had it was when I had a wonderful meal at Ruth Chris Steak House and they served it to me there. I was so entranced by it,I asked the waitress where they bought it. Not only did she tell me, she also gave me four tea bags to take home! Needless to say, I've been hooked since then. This tea is just sweet and spicy enough to be absolutely satisfying. It tastes remarkably like the red hot cinnamon candy - which if you had asked me beforehand if I would like, I would have said no. But it's just the right blend to make it perfect. Another reason I love it is because it satisfies my sweets craving without actually  having to have sweets. Who wouldn't love a nice zero-calorie tea that tastes just as good as the candy? Try it for yourself - you will love it!"
386818,B000PGQQFC,NickisratingstuffonAmazon,I feel so fancy drinking this,"I am addicted to caffeine. If there were street pushers in shady parts of town selling it, I would be there looking for my fix. Thankfully, it is a legal stimulant and Amazon is my dealer.  Hot Cinnamon Spice is not so much a radical break from my normal coffee and tea habits, it is more of a revelation that I can get a heck of a flavor along with that sweet caffeine hit.  It has a fairly strong cinnamon smell, but the flavor is neither overpowering nor ""hot"" as the name may say. I would recommend drinking without adding any sugar, milk or cream to it, as it is sweet in it's natural state and this is a flavor that should not be drowned out. That, and milk is disgusting.  After I made a cup at work, the vultures started circling wondering what the wonderful aroma was. 50 bags seemed silly to purchase, but with by freeloader coworkers they will be gone in no time.  I give it two snaps up."
386819,B000PGQQFC,Jennifer Paretchan,Heavenly,Hands down most delicious tea I have ever had. In fact it tastes so decadent it doesn't even taste like tea.

A bargain really considering that you get 50 large bags in a box. I would advise that this tea tastes quite sweet to me without any added ingredients out of the box. So go careful on sugar. May I suggest pairing this with the wonderful organic agave cinnamon sweetner available through Amazon as a compliment. (ASIN: B0048INV38). This makes it a cinnabomb.
386822,B000PGQQFC,"Oranges ""with Cheese""","Better than the original ""spice"" tea","I've tried two different brands of cinnamon spice tea, and even though this is most likely derivative of the first brand, Harney & Sons' version is so much better. It isn't quite as bitter and the cinnamon gives you a more rounded taste, instead of being overpowering. The scent is intoxicating, and the tea tastes naturally sweet - its great for a cold day!"

While still better flavor than many teas, I was disappointed with this in comparison with the slightly more expensive tin version."

386835,B000PGQQFC,Ctwink,Great High Quality Tea With A Strong Cinnamon Taste,"I've enjoyed an Orange Pekoe and Black Tea blend for years.  About eight years ago, I was introduced to an Indonesian brand that was a blend of Orange Pekoe, Black Tea, and Cinnamon.  It was incredible!  However, it was bought at a discount store and I was never able to purchase it retail - despite my dogged attempts.  Ever since, I have been forced to go from one imitator to another looking for a replacement. Enter Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice which I first purchased at a specialty store that carried somewhat exotic products and have since purchased on Amazon.com.  What can I say other than WOW!!!!  This tea has such an INCREDIBLE taste.  It is almost indescribable how beautifully the black tea mixes with the cinnamon and orange in your tea cup.  I love the cinnamon taste so much, I actually OVER steep my tea bag in order to infuse as much of the powerful cinnamon taste as possible.  I'm sure many tea enthusiasts in the UK and here in the US would be aghast at the thought of over-steeping tea as normally you would be left with a strongly bitter cup as the black tea would infuse too much of its taste into the water.  However, this does not happen with Harney & Sons.  Instead, the only thing you get is a stronger and stronger cinnamon & orange taste.  I steep my tea so long that I often have to reheat my cup, but it is so utterly delicious (that would be the basking in fields of flowers with rainbows and unicorns kind of delicious) that I'm willing to wait another minute or two.  Add a little sweetener and a touch of cream and its TO DIE FOR!!! As you can see, I can't say enough good things about either Harney & Sons teas in general or the Hot Cinnamon Spice blend in particular.  I was so happy to find this tea - it truly blows away any brand that I've found - one of the many instances where you win when you pay for quality!"

This is def my new obsession!"
386837,B000PGQQFC,calicoterri,Wonderful cinnamon flavor,"This cinnamon tea tastes slightly sweet even without honey or sugar.  When I ran out of the tea bags, I reached into my tea storage cannister and found some 2 year old tea sachet bags.  I tried them and they were still full of flavor after sitting unused for 2 years.  Makes a great gift too."

Glad the gift tea should be better! I LIKE cinnamon - but to love these tea bags, it would help if you love cinnamon (especially if you enjoy Red Hots or hot spicy food). I usually enjoy my tea strong and with milk, but I suspect I'll be diluting this one with lots of milk. So far, I've found Harney & Sons tea to be high-quality tea - and cinnamon is healthy, so I'm okay with this purchase. But I don't plan to restock this zinger in my pantry :)"

I ordered the 50 packet box and need to reorder already as I keep giving these packets away and everyone who has tried it loves it!  The tea smells fabulous, is bold and tasty.  I tend to like honey in my tea, and find this is truly the best cup of tea around!  I love it and think if you are considering, you should give it a try!  You may want to check Harney and Sons website directly as they actually sell it for a bit cheaper, but be sure to check whether Amazon winds up being a better deal due to shipping costs.

This ""Hot Cinnamon Spice"" is an excellent cold-weather tea: a pervasive cinnamon aroma with just a hint of orange, and a nice balance between the subtle spice and the tea flavors (assuming for a moment you want to taste the tea, not just the spices, that is.) I'm not fond of herbs and spices that totally overwhelm the underlying tea -- this preparation was actually better than I expected.

It was hard for me to appreciate the choices I have in the states as far as tea is concerned (Black tea specifically) because none of the black tea I find here tastes good to me unless I turn it into chai by adding milk and spices. But this tea does not need even a crystal of sugar because the combinations of cinnamon and sweet cloves they use make it naturally sweet and it smells heavenly too. Every time I go back to India, I order a box to take with me. The tea comes in different packages. You can buy the large rectangular bags which come in shiny copper-colored tins which are not value for money compared to these individually wrapped, slightly smaller tea bags.

It is not overly hot like the (only) bad review says, except for maybe the fact that you may be willing to scald your tongue to drink it, its that good! One thing to note is some of the actual tea bags aren't very secure on the top, and the tea will likely pour into your cup. Might want to staple it down a bit more."
386863,B000PGQQFC,Jen E,My New Favorite Tea,This might be my new favorite tea - the scent is just divine and it needs  very little in the way of sweetening.
386864,B000PGQQFC,jv,An experience,"This is more than just a tea. It truly is an experience. It has a multi-layered flavor of cinnamon and spices that are luscious. I treat myself to a cup of this tea whenever it is snowy outside, or even when I have just had a tiring day. You will love it (-:"

386866,B000PGQQFC,DR,Wonderful tea!,"While I love cinnamon rolls, I'm not a huge fan of red hots, cinnamon gum, etc. but this tea is delicious!  It tastes like a very mild (not hot at all) red hot.  Everyone I have served it to has loved it--even those who aren't fans of hot tea.  Please note that this is not an herbal tea--it is caffeinated and has black tea mixed in, which is delicious."
386867,B000PGQQFC,J. Goodell,The Best,"This is the only cinnamon tea that actually tastes like cinnamon.  It's spicy and sweet.  $0.30 a cup (shipping added) is high for an at home beverage, but I never need to use 2 tea bags for flavor.  The best on the market."
386868,B000PGQQFC,Saneta,Cinnamon Tea,"This tea is good if you really like the strong taste of cinnamon and spice. It kind of tasted like the gum, Big Red. I didn't expect the strong taste so that is why I gave it a 4. There is also a sweet after taste which was interesting too."
386869,B000PGQQFC,jennifer griffin,Addicted!,Most cinnamon teas are herbal. I love the blend with the black tea. It really helps me in the afternoon with a bit of caffeine vs going for coffee. I love it and buy it in bulk!
386870,B000PGQQFC,parissuffren,A Tea That Can Take you Away,"I got hooked on Harney & Sons teas some time ago. It started with their Paris tea, and I imagined that I was back in Paris with every sip. So that led me to try the Hot Cinnamon Spice, the heady aroma of the cinnamon made me think of Morocco. The first sip I was transported by the smooth flavor and yet there was an intense melding of slightly sweet and hot spice. Once again, hooked. My 18 year old son loves it too! If you love tea, these teas are the best out there!"
386871,B000PGQQFC,"Crystal ""Crys""",Hot Tamale Tea,"I had this tea once at Einstein Bagel and decided that I NEEDED to find this tea. I found it on Amazon and order 2 boxes. I call it my Hot Tamale tea because it pretty much tastes exactly like the candies of the same name. I am not a tea drinker, especially not unsweetened tea, but this I can drink without adding anything to it. I love it and highly recommend it."
386872,B000PGQQFC,"Gina B ""It's a dry heat!""",Great cinnamon tea!,"This tea is exactly what I wanted - rich, warm, spicy cinnamon tea!  The tea is so well-packaged that you can't even smell the tea bag without opening the foil pouches, which means they're keeping the tea fresh.  I've brewed this tea in hot milk also for a very nice cinnamon milk tea.  Perfect tea for a chilly night and goes wonderfully with a piece of pumpkin pie.  :)"
386873,B000PGQQFC,SanDee Litney,Awesome!,I stumbled on to the tea and flavor at the JW Marriott. I absolutely love it and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  Mix it with honey - it is fantastic.

They shipped promptly altho 1 box of 50 tea bags arrived in a large box with foam peanuts.I feel postage could have been lowered if tea box was sent in a smaller appropriate size box. the cinnamon spice tea is delicious and as promised I received a sample of one of their other teas. I will order again.
386876,B000PGQQFC,Ciao Bella,"Not a fan of cinnamon, but this was DE-LIC-IOUS!","I had mine in a latte style, made with milk.  SO GOOD.  Would definitely recommend trying it, even if you are not a big cinnamon fan.  I enjoy cinnamon, but I wouldn't say I love it  so don't shy away just because everyone raves about the cinnamon flavor.  It definitely feels like a fall/holiday treat with the cinnamon and spice flavor."

386880,B000PGQQFC,W. Chan,"TEA SO GOOD, IT CAN MAKE A TEAPOT TASTE LIKE FOOD","My friend raved about this tea. She said it is the best tea on earth, world, wherever. I did not believe a word she said until recently when I personally tried it. I did not know a combination of hot, cinnamon, spice can be so delicious. Once I opened the tea pack, I can smell an aroma of cinnamon. If you love cinnamon, you can't go wrong with this tea. But if you hate cinnamon, you will want to throw this on the ground. As for myself, I love cinnamon. This tea is flavorful and different from other teas. The first sip of the tea, you will taste a bit of cinnamon. The second sip of the tea, you will taste a bit of spice. The third sip of the tea, you will taste a bit of sweetness. It is simply wonderful. You want quality tea? Harney & Sons - Hot Cinnamon Spice will not disappoint you. Okay, it's tea time."
386881,B000PGQQFC,H. Drum,Whoever said this was crack tea they were right,LOVE this tea.  I gave away a bag at work one day and the next thing I knew 3 people came by my office and I got 2 emails wanting to know where the tea with the heavenly scent came from.  JUST BUY IT!!!! I've had at least two dozen people try it and not one has disliked it. If you still uncertain go by Caribou and order their Hot Cinnamon Tea Harney is their distributor.  I must say you need to buy it in the silken sachets it's much better tasting that way but this way is darn good too.  I'm a facebook fan of Harney tea so I posted a concern that they were out and they emailed me the day it was coming back into stock and I bought a 50 ct bag  in decaf for $13.50. Low and Behold I went back the next day to add a bag and it was out again.
386882,B000PGQQFC,M. McEwen,Crack TEA,"What do they put in this tea? Crack? Seriously, I know flavored teas are gimmicky and blah blah fancy heritage oolong is the pinnacle of tea, but I LIKE this. It's totally flavorful and addicting! Plus, unlike chai, it doesn't need the addition of milk or honey. I'm sure they make it with crack because it makes my office smell like potpourri for several days, but I still love it."
386883,B000PGQQFC,"Shear ""Io""",I have found the tea.,"This tea is fantastic.  Like another here, I am passing bags out to as many people as I can find.

In addition, the guy selling the stuff here gives good customer service.  This tea is best paired with European sugar cubes.  I do not use milk, but I think this tea would be good with it or half and half.  The tea has clarity of taste that outshines other teas.  The quality is tops. Fall is a great time of the year to enjoy this tea.  You can not go wrong with this stuff!"

386891,B00668AST8,Lisa Kearns,"Natural, no calorie, and tastes great","I've been wanting to try stevia (the plant that is used in this product) for a long time, and finally picked up this container at the grocery store.  I didn't buy it on Amazon but wanted to share my impression with other shoppers. The little jar is rather expensive, but stevia is very concentrated and you only need a tiny bit for most uses.  I like the container, with the flip top lid that allow me to use a spoon without screwing off a lid. The product itself is very nice!  I've used it for several weeks in my morning tea, and I'm a convert.  It gives my tea a nicely sweetened taste and I haven't detected any aftertaste.  I only use about 1/4 teaspoon in two cups of hot water (I have a big mug for my tea). I'm going to explore Amazon and the rest of the Internet for a bulk sized package of this sweetener.  Unfortunately it would be nearly impossible to grow my own stevia in my herb garden, so I'll have to buy it instead."

386896,B003H2TI3I,D. A. J.,I am in love!,"I really, really liked these nuggets! These are akin to boneless nuggets you would find at a restaurant, but without the messy sauce. Of course, these are bagged, shelf stable nuggets - so they are a bit salty (which means you won't risk death upon eating them). I love the size of this bag as it is great for snacking - only 90 calories! The shelf life was great as mine don't expire until Dec. of 2011 (purchased Feb. of 2011). I will be keeping a pack in the car, a pack in my desk at work, and they are great for grabbing on the run for a quick snack. These are buffalo, so there is a good and HOT spice with them.  Another big thing for me is having something yummy, fun, and interesting to eat in case of an emergency (like a weather event that takes out the power). What would you want to eat - canned tuna or buffalo nuggets to get you through a power outage? See, reason enough to order - you can add them to your emergency preparedness bag - LOL.It looks expensive, but the price is actually really good. Less than you would pay in the grocery store and the smaller size bag means you don't have to refrigerate leftovers or over indulge (there is a lot of salt). I can imagine taking these camping, to sporting events, or anywhere that a ""semi"" healthy snack is warranted or you just get a craving for buffalo nuggets! Will definitely be purchasing more of these!"

The point that it has no gluten, is ridiculous when it is STOCKPILED OF SUGAR!!!!!!!!! So, instead of gluten, an individual can FATTEN THEMSELVES UP with sugar! Further, if you suffer from a sugar addiction, and gluten--- THIS IS definitely a huge let down. Sugar in any form such as malto dextrin, dextrose, organic sugar (I love it when they nickname this one as being organic as if the chemical composition is any different on the body!), WHEN ARE THE MANUFACTURERS GOING TO MAKE REAL healtlhy products that have ingredients that ARE TRULY FOR THE HEALTH CONSCIOUS. By omitting one ingredient such as gluten, you have done NOTHING to help consumers with health allergies---- instead you have dumped humongous amounts of the number ONE SUBSTANCE IN THE U.S. THAT Americans are addicted to;  sugar"
386902,B004YUF8UO,"Goldwave ""shopper""",Ghastly Sponges in Mouth-Burning Sugar Syrup,"This tastes like I imagine a regular sponge would.  They look that way too.  Indeed, I am suspicious that these aren't really ""cottage cheese patties"" or paneer at all.  I've bought paneer for years and I know what it looks, feels and tastes like.  I've no idea what the heck this is, but I think this company is engaged in some funny business in what it's putting in the product. Beyond that, these sponges are soaked in an uber sweet sugar syrup with a slight hint of rose.  That's to be expected for an Indian sweet of this type; however, this stuff actually not only burns your tongue and throat, but mine was still burning 8 HOURS AFTER CONSUMING ONE PATTY, WHICH I HAD SQUEEZED AND RINSED WITH WATER TO REMOVE AS MUCH SYRUP AS POSSIBLE. I would strongly advise others not to purchase this product.  I was expecting something completely different than what I received.  Oh and also all the cans were heavily dented upon arrival."

386907,B000H6J75G,"W. Hoyt ""Pee Wee Shooter""",Great taste gourmet treat on a budget!,"First off if you are looking for one of the super dark 70%+ chocolateThe bars this is NOT for you.  The chocolate is dark, however not bitter at all and has a slightly sweet taste.  The dark, rich, full chocolate flavor is apparent and is complimented well by the creamy texture and smooth taste in the mouth. The dark chocolate bars are made in the USA in Novato, CA.  Torn Ranch is a company that supplys high end treats mainly in the hospitality market.  Might be difficult to find unless you fly first class or stay at a 5 star hotel.  You can direct order online at tornranch.com.  Though if you do these are going to set you back $3 each plus taxand shipping with a 6 bar minimum.  Amazon was 31 for 24 and no tax plus Prime as a shipping option.  A GREAT deal. Package was interesting.  The 24 came in a large, ugly, cardboard box that had been directly sent by itself to amazon,  Basically 24 loose bars in a Torn Ranch shipping box.  So if you are looking at giving this whole as a gift the package will be lacking.  They are individually packaged with each bar having a sealed plastic inner sleeve that is surrounded by a nice printed light cardboard outer box.  The chocolate is sectinal - unlike the other review these are now three piece to a bar. Very, very tastey treat that I will reorder once these 24 are gone.  However, would not reccomend youy buy this as a gift to send (all 24 at once anyway) as the packaging for ther 24 is pretty rough and not eye pleasing."

These dark chocolate bars are two ounces each.  One half of the bar (a one ounce serving) is only one hundred and forty calories. The bars are thick and have a nice snap to them when you break them apart and the taste is rich, not too sweet, not bitter and very satisfying.  Delicious chocolate and a great value since you get twenty-four bars for about $1.18 per bar.  I'll be buying these again!"

Note to self: some things in life are just not possible. A 100 calorie pack of chocolate covered pretzels will either contain very few pretzels or will contain very little chocolate. Nabisco chose the latter. How many little pretzel ""O's"" are in a 100 calorie pack? About 5 or 6. How much chocolate coating does each little ""O"" have? A very thin coating of not very good quality milk chocolate. I realize other reviewers have loved these, however, I found them disappointing.

386933,B004ZIO6RG,Rob,Rotten and covered in mold,"I decided that i should first research how to germinate acorns, they said you should soak them in hot water for 24 hours. I did. None of the seeds sunk, I know that it is not a completely reliable method to prove the viability of the seeds, but still! out of the 10 acorns that I bought, none sunk! They floated like dead fish. So I decided to open with a hammer 3 acorns to check their appearance. 2 out of the 3 were completely rotten with mold covering their entire surface. I would definitively not buy these seeds again! However, I have bought several species in excellent condition from this seller, that germinated."
386934,B003D4MFUS,"J. Finkel ""Jack of Trades""","Fizzy Juice, yum",The peach flavor of Knudsen Spritzers is one of their best (i also recommend strawberry and mango fandango).  The soda doesn't contain any added sugar or other undesirables.  While the main juice isn't peach juice (most of their spritzers are predominantly grape or apple juices) it does have enough peach juice to give it a distinct peach flavor.  Some people may find these spritzers a little too sweet.  I like to drink mine with ice or a little seltzer added.  I've tried other competing brands and find these spritzers the best all-juice sodas out there.
386935,B003D4MFUS,shfini,Peach Spritzer from Amazon,"I love that I can get the Knudsen Peach Spritzer on Amazon, because I can only find it at one store in my city of 80,000 people.  I am especially pleased that I can have a case sent to me automatically on a turnaround of my choosing. I believe the Peach  flavor is the nearest to the actual fruit flavor of all the spritzers, and is the most refreshing. Having free shipping means  I can better afford to keep this product on hand.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4MFUS"">R.W. Knudsen Spritzer, Peach, 10.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>"
386936,B001SAU2N6,Heather Feather,Best Ice Cream EVER!,"I had this ice cream once. It was the best ice cream I had ever had in my life. Its so smooth and creamy. Everyone I made it for enjoyed it a lot. I can't believe they don't sell this in more stores. I would really enjoy purchasing many of these, but it seems amazon has  made a mistake in the shipping weight. This error will cause your shipping to be just as much if not more than the ice cream itself. I have tried calling and emailing with no response. They say the package of 12 boxes is 10lbs. Well, as you can see, each box is approximately 4oz each. About 1/4 of a pound. So 12 boxes would only be about 3lbs. Not 10lbs.Hopefully writing this review will get the problem solved. I would really love to purchase this ice cream soon."
386937,B001SAU2N6,lynl,Yummy,"If you have a Cuisinart or other home ice cream maker, very easy to make good chocolate ice cream with the Junket Mix. Even good using non-fat milk. Just mix milk and contents of Junket package-25 minutes later-you have ice cream. Can be eaten right away or stored in freezer. Quick delicious dessert for a dinner party as it can be freezing while the main course is being eaten.  Also add-ins such as nuts, chopped candy bars, and fruit make it even more special.  Try toasted almonds with Mounds candy bar."
386938,B001SAU2N6,maddog,Junket Ice cream,"This is a great inexpensive mix.  We use Lactaid brand milk to make ice cream for my lactose intolerant family members.  Fun and easy, with or without an ice cream maker!"
386939,B001SAU2N6,Bo Zimmerman,The Secret Ingredient ,"This little box contains a brown chocolaty powder.  The instructions tell you to add two things: whole milk and whipping cream.  By itself, whole milk and whipping cream, with a little sugar and frozen, IS ice cream.  So what does this little box give you that some sugar and powdered cocoa doesn't? I have no idea, but it's worth it. Whatever is in this powder does two things you won't get from the plain ingredients alone: volume, and thickness.  The ice cream was thickening so quickly that what should have taken 20 minutes to reach was thick enough to overwhelm my electric machine in 10.  The volume more than doubled over the liquid base, which is about 50% more than with plain ingredients.  These alone make it worth it. Flavor-wise, there are no complaints.  It's chocolaty and sweet  nothing spectacular, but no worse than you'd get out of your store freezer."

386942,B001SAU2N6,"Steven A. Andersen ""goose""",Junket gets it done,Junket has been around for decades.  I saw my great grandmother use it for ice cream.  Recently we saw it advertised and bought a small case of it.  We were amazed at how great the chocolate Ice Cream Mix came out.( the one we bought)  It was awesome and lightning fast without the egg custard necessary for good quality ice cream. We even used just whole milk and no cream and it was great ice cream..We recommend this product for those that want a quick treat or a handsome dessert done done up just before dinner guests arrive.  You do have to use two of the small boxes for a good quart but Who knew?
386943,B001SAU2N6,Susan,Junket is Still the best,"Junket Ice Cream Mix is great.  I have always loved it, but our stores stopped carrying it. Buying online was no problem and I was happy to find it.  It is still the best ice cream mix on the market."
386944,B001SAU2N6,ronald balesano,Outstanding Product,"This product was every bit a good as some of the ""best"" brands.  The chocolate was rich and smooth.  I made it in my ice cream maker and it was outstanding.. I also made it by following the instructions on the box and the results were just as good.. I would recommend this product!"
386945,B001SAU2N6,oldhorseartist,Junket - a blast from the past,"I remembered Junket mix from my childhood so I searched the Internet to find if it was still being made. Voila, of course and of course Amazon had it. I love it. Mix it up and put it in my ice cream maker, turn on the machine and shortly enjoy great ice cream. Yummm."
386946,B005NDXEM0,chris,i expected it to be bigger then it was however its worth the 26 dollars,not as big as it looks but was worth the money. everything in the box is really small not much to it. for 26 dollars not bad tho you get what you pay for
386947,B005NDXEM0,Amanda M.,a good assortment of different things,"This box isn't HUGE, but it's not tiny either.  I got it because of the variety of items it seemed to have, and it didn't disappoint. That being said: because it has 27 items or whatever, all of the items are pretty small (I was expecting this, so I'm NOT lowering it's ranking for this).  If you're looking for a large amount of meat and cheese, I'd get something else, as while the meat and cheese were both very good, the logs were small and went fairly quickly.  The sweet things in it were quite good as well, and offered something different to eat- and the sweet/hot mustard was loved by all. My only complaint was that the only item that was either 1. not liked at all or 2. simply ""ok"" to most people that were eating out of this (6 people) was the Spice Cheese, which seems to be the only item that is repeated- as I believe there were a total of 3 of them in the box.  If you really liked the Spice Cheese, however, that might make your day.  The replication of that one item instead of putting in something else twice, or something different, is the only reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars. In short: very good variety, though small items."
386948,B005NDXEM0,LARRY  GIRTON,Swiss Colony 27 favorites,My Swiss Colony 27 favorites was received in the time advertised and in the best of shape. My family and friends dove right in on the day received and we found the product fresh and Delicious as well as plentiful.  Thank You for a wonderful product at a more than reasonable price!
386949,B005NDXEM0,Mad_Ducks,Good for the value,I sent this as a gift so I cannot comment on it too much. I do know that my friends were very pleased once they received it. It arrived on the date it said it would.
386950,B005NDXEM0,Rhonda Staats,Good last minute,"This was a great last minute Christmas present,  As I procrastinated almost to late. But Thank You  It got there on time. I ordered three of them and sent them to three  \different people, so it worked out great."
386951,B005NDXEM0,Madeline W,very nice presentation,"I thought this this was very nice (to give as a gift) But as the other person said The shipping label took the gift idea to a new level. I will never order this again for a gift, but just in case anyone else gets stuck with this because of the label, this is what I did--I took a small xmas gift bag and cut out a santa picture and pasted it over where I had peeled off the shipping label, so now it looked more like a gift!!"
386952,B005NDXEM0,martysc,Great Gift - fast shipping,Ordered this for a Christmas gift just a few days ago and wasn't sure if it would make it to the recipient before Christmas (going Super Saver shipping via USPS). Just got a call that it arrived today in great condition and they are loving it - a wonderful variety of items that all taste good. Guess I've got a new Christmas tradition  
386953,B005NDXEM0,Sidphx,Gift Box Doubles as Shipping Carton,Regardless as to how good or bad the food items are I don't consider this to be a 'gift box' as a 4x7 inch non-removable shipping label was slapped on top of the box. As I was giving this to a friend for Christmas I attempted to remove the label. The holiday box design came up in strips along with the label. As one pays a premium for these food samples one does so because they are arranged and displayed attractively and come in a 'gift box' to be given as gifts.

386962,B004EE2UR4,T. Collins,love this tea,I've always purchased this tea in bags. Wanted to see if it tasted the same in the kcups. I really do love this tea but it is economicly better to by it by the bags. kcups are great and convenient but just a bit more than I want to spend right now ..
386963,B004EE2UR4,RescueRanger,"Good, but ","I like it, but . there's a little bit too much of a sharp after taste. Even adding a ton of sugar didn't make up for it entirely. The product still has good flavor, but I'd gladly take Lipton Spiced Chai over this, if only the Lipton came in a K-Cup."

I like this brand and Bigelow organic green tea. I think the Bigelow is my slight favorite, but this is good tea. No aftertaste and nor are there grounds in the bottom of the cup. The price on this one puts everything to shame. Usually the K-cups are more expensive, so this is a bargain. Get it now."

You get 6 boxes of 20, so that is 60 servings for me (2 bags at a time) for the 13.95 (subscribe and save) these cups used to be. If I want the tea a bit stronger, I will remove the tea bags after brewing from the my k-cup and throw them in my mug. Let is steep a bit longer and it is wonderful!"

386980,B004EE2UR4,Buffy,Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai,"What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Bigelow and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake."
386981,B004EE2UR4,Ready2Fly,expensive and a waste of plastic,"$15 for 24 servings??  that is crazy, especially that you can get green teas in a box cost a few bucks.  Also, the plastic cups go in landfill.  i will never buy these cups again."

I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend."
386983,B004EE2UR4,Ferdy,Converted me to tea over coffee - it's that good,"Before buying my Keurig brewer, I never really like black tea.  I would drink herbal tea from tme to time but black tea always seemed too bitter.  After trying Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Tea, I was instantly converted.  There is no bitter taste and it's so much less acidic than coffee and therefore much easier on my stomach.  It has a mild, slightly fruity taste that is perfect with breakfast or really anytime of day.  I've tried it plain and with a bit of milk and sugar as well.  I honestly have become more of a tea drinker than coffee drinker since trying this delicious tea."

386985,B004EE2UR4,Holly Mardis,Great Flavor,"I drink this tea nearly every day (sometimes twice) and really like the flavor.

386988,B004EE2UR4,M. Dowdie,The best tea I've had,"I'm not a hot tea connoisseur, but I am a big iced tea drinker and occasional hot tea drinker.  These K-cups makes some of the best tea I've had anywhere and I've started to actually crave it.  I set the brewer for 12 ounces and it makes the tea about the right strength for my taste.  The 8 ounce setting also does fine.  Highly recommended."

This green tea is perfect hot or cold! I use Stevia and it taste perfect. With the cooler months upon us, this will make a great hot drink to sip on not to mention the benefits of green tea! Buy it you won't be disappointed!"
386990,B004EE2UR4,"kzoomn ""Audiophile""",Great substiture for AM coffee.,Taste is what it's all about and this tea not only tastes very good but is a welcome change to the morning coffee.  These Green Tea cups (IMHO )provide just the right brewing strength. Another plus is that you don't have to wait for the tea to brew. Using the 10oz setting is just right for me. If you want a stronger brew then use the 8oz setting.
386991,B004EE2UR4,Shan Luc Picard,Where's The Cardamon?  Prepare for the Cloveaload!,"If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you.  If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is ""this is NOT chai tea.""  There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea.  As it is, it should be called ""spicy clove tea.""  This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices.  It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves.  I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region.  Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors.  Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.  I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically. I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a ""traditional"" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand.  For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the ""chai"" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original."
386992,B004EE2UR4,Keith M. Heston,Great for regular chai or latte,"I love this chai, and it makes a much better chai latte than I've tried in any k-cup before.  To be clear, this doesn't come with powdered milk or cream, so you have to add your own cream in order to make it a latte. I have disliked all of the pre-mixed latte k-cups I've tried because of a combination of artificial sweatener (which they all seem to insist on adding) and the powdered creamer (which is worse than fresh).  I add my own sugar and cream to this chai, and it is delicious! When I tried this without cream and sugar, it tasted slightly heavy on the clove.  With the cream and sugar, though, I don't have any complaints."
386993,B004EE2UR4,A12345,Hate this :(,I love Chai Tea.  I don't even put sugar or honey in my Chai Tea.  This was just not right.  Tasted burnt out of the keurig and the cloves are overpowering.  No amount of honey and milk could make this right for me.  I am suffering through my 24-pack and may just throw it out.  Very disappointing.  I've had this brand/flavor in the bags before (although not recently) and liked it just fine.  Even bought it multiple times.  Not sure what is not working right with the k-cup formula.
386994,B004EE2UR4,Liltink,Great Tea!,"Just received my new coffee maker as a gift. One of the sample K-Cups was this black tea. I set it at 8 ounces.It was so delicious, with a bit of sugar and a bit of cream. I love Red Label English Breakfast Tea and this was as good or even better. Do not be afraid of this tea, you will not regret it. No bitter bite from over processing, just yummmmmmmmm!"
386995,B004EE2UR4,M.S.G,Great tea,"I prefer tea that is not steeped too long. This tea is the closest I have found to the way I would make it myself. I run it through the Keurig twice, once at 10oz and once at 12 oz and it comes out exactly the way I like it. You may not prefer as weak a tea, but that can be solved by running it through only once.  It has a clean, refreshing flavor."
386996,B004EE2UR4,AJLMD13,Best Breakfast Tea,"I drink this every morning with a tablespoon of sugar. Great tea with just the right amount of caffeine to survive the long, early mornings. Strongly recommend."
386997,B004EE2UR4,G Elizabeth,Best Cup of Tea!!,"I received a Keurig machine for Christmas, so I purchased this tea yet I wasn't expecting much. Well I found that this makes the BEST CUP OF TEA!! I have to pace myself because I could just drink cup after cup it is that good!!"
386998,B004EE2UR4,Kit,Tea Time,This black tea is delicious and I have found that reusing the cup doesn't affect the flavor until the 4th or 5th cup.
386999,B004EE2UR4,gcet,taste great!,I love this tea! My wife is usually the big tea drinker in the house but after trying this in my Keurig I have to say I LOVE it. I didn't purchase through amazon though because I got the same amount 24 in a box for only 9.99 elsewhere but I would recommend it to anyone.
387000,B004EE2UR4,Carrien,Weak Flavor,"I love k-cups. They're pretty cool, and I like the idea of them, but I don't like sacrificing the flavor just for the sake of a cup. The tea tastes very watered down for some reason. And I am a tea drinker who doesn't add sugar/honey because I enjoy the natural sweetening properties in the actual herbs. But this herbal tea is missing something, especially with a name like 'Authentic Green Tea'. It's pretty disappointing for the price of these things, but I'll continue to drink it until I run out."
387032,B004EE2UR4,GoldDove,Delicious tea,"I have always wanted to try brewing real English tea. I bought these for my Keurig, and they were so, so much better than my normal tea bags.  They may not be as good as real, brewed tea, but I think they're delicious."
387002,B004EE2UR4,"Allan J. Lueb ""Benzmeister""",Great Tea,Great tea and a great bargain if you own a K cup machine. Buy your coffee or tea at Amazon. The prices are great and the service is great. Ordering from Amazon direct is seamless.
387003,B004EE2UR4,Jan-64,Good Black Tea,"This is my favorite tea for the Keurig brewer.  I do not like, and therefore don't drink, flavored tea.  This is the tea I prefer.  I have not been able to get in stores lately so I ordered online."
387004,B004EE2UR4,aemesko,Tea,I use this tea as an ice tea instead of a breakfast tea. It is really refreshing and allows me to make one cup of ice tea at a time. If you find it a little strong you can add more ice or ice water.
387005,B004EE2UR4,"Good_Times ""southshoresales""",Just Plain Good!,"I love this tea and I am not really a tea person, but this is a great drink and it is a very tasty treat."
387006,B004EE2UR4,S. Hokanson,"A little weak at the 12 oz mug, but still tasty","I use the Keurig Platinum (B70) brewer and the 12 oz. brew size. This K-Cup is a little weak at the 12 oz. size, but still enjoyable, as I usually make it a latte. For comparison, a Tazo Chai tea bag makes a slightly stronger cup at 12 oz than the Celestial Seasonings K-Cup. Compared to Timothy's Chai K-Cup, Celestial's Chai is stronger (which I prefer)."
387007,B004EE2UR4,sammi,Disappointed!,"Wanted to sample the K-cups. Previously a ""tea bag"" user for the same product.  Will stick with the tea bags, as the tea is not only more fragrant, but extremely flavorful. Will not purchase K-cups again."
387008,B004EE2UR4,"Paula Ali ""pfali18""",Indian Spice Chai,This is a very nice chai doesn't taste like I thought it would..has a very strong spice taste..but still very good.
387009,B004EE2UR4,ann,great tea,"this tea is wonderfully spicy.  great on a cold afternoon! It would also be lovely with milk, but I prefer it plain."
387010,B004EE2UR4,matt615,"licorice taste, twinings chai is much better",I am really disappointed in this chai tea. It has a distinct licorice taste. Twinings chai tea is much better. Do not buy unless you like a licorice taste.
387011,B004EE2UR4,Bailey,Celestial Chia Tea,This Tea is really good. It comes in an easy to use container.  Its not very sweet so if you want your tea really sweet you may need to add something. Good produxt.
387012,B004EE2UR4,mrmrsstone,I love Chai tea,This is very good and makes the house smell wonderful.  I would defintely recommend this to anyone just wanting a quick tea.
387013,B004EE2UR4,N. Bunch,Favorite K Cup Overall,This is my favorite K Cup overall!  I love the flavor the the tea and it brews just right on the medium setting.
387014,B004EE2UR4,TK,Celestial India spice chai tea k-cups,"I brew this in a keurig 60 model, i like this tea, its good any time of the year. It is on the spicy side and will leave your pallet with a spicy after taste. But oh so good late at night. Good tea for every once in a while, i could not drink this every day as is a little on the strong side."
387015,B004EE2UR4,pamie884,My favorite tea!,"This tea is the reason why I bought a Keurig. It's my absolute favorite. I make a cup each morning to take with me to work (anyone who works a 9-5 needs a pick me up!). I usually re-order two boxes every couple of months, and my package always arrives quickly. I'll be buying these k-cups as long as they're available!"
387016,B004EE2UR4,susan katz,Great Cup of Chai,This is the best Chai I have found for my Keurig. It is not overly sweet like another kind I tried. It smells and tastes wonderful. Great on a cold night!
387017,B004EE2UR4,"A. You ""Genius""",Not good,"This is not even tea, it is not even as good as dipping a tea bag in the cup once. It's You'll be drinking hot water with sugar and honey."
387018,B004EE2UR4,David Rupert,My wife loves this stuff,"I get this for my wife who really loves it.  I am not a tea drinker, other than ice tea."
387019,B004EE2UR4,sad1969,Good Tea,This is a good Strong Tea. The Flavor is a nice blend not to strong and not weak. Smells great when brewing. You can add milk or drink it plain.
387020,B004EE2UR4,J. Seaman,Tastes great!,Great tea for the Keurig.  We love it!  Now for a good cocoa and apple cider.(Don't get the Green Mountain cider)
387021,B004EE2UR4,Shan,Very weak taste ..,"I have purchased the Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea tea bags in the grocery store, and was impressed with the flavor. So when I saw they had them in the K-cups, I immediately jumped on them and ordered a box. I was so disappointed in it. It tastes nothing like their regular tea bag version. Weak is a word I would use. And I'm not sure what kind of spices they put it in, but it's nothing like any other chai tea I've had. I do not recommend this brand. If you're a regular chai drinker, you will notice the difference and likely be disappointed."
387022,B004EE2UR4,Clockmilk,Potent!,"This stuff is surprisingly strong and potent. I've always had a problem with chai tea bags because they brew such a dilute cup of tea. But with the Celestial Seasonings Keurig chai, the tea is dark and opaque. I got a huge buzz off of the caffeine. Best of all, it's pure tea and spices, unlike the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte, which is full of artificial ingredients."
387023,B004EE2UR4,Reuben J Trane Jr,Clove flavor?,"I like the tea - but I noticed both an aroma and flavor of clove? I don't think this is ONLY green tea. That being said, I like it and most likely will reorder."
387024,B004EE2UR4,LKH,Couldn't even finish one cup,"I'm an avid chai drinker--many different varieties of both lattes and straight black tea.  We purchased this product because we noticed that the Cafe Escapes chai lattes--a sweeter, creamier blend--did not actually have much black tea in it, and we still wanted our morning caffeine.  Neither my husband nor I could finish one mug of this stuff, and we will end up getting rid of the box.  It was that awful. There was none of the subtle spice blending--just a watery slightly clove-tasting flavor undercut by a bitterness that almost had hints of coffee. Adding a little milk, as we usually do, didn't help at all.  If you enjoy chai, I'd recommend Bigalow or Tazo and skip this one."
387025,B004EE2UR4,Stuart Johnston,Not strong enough,"Smells nice but the flavor is weak.  I don't think the Keurig brewers really work for tea.  Good tea needs to be steeped, not just filtered like coffee."
387026,B004EE2UR4,Cheminsite,Cloves Overpowering,There is a very strong clove flavor in this tea. I like my tea black and did not enjoy it very much. My friend from work added cream and sugar to it and thought it was great.
387027,B004EE2UR4,awaykate,Yummy Tea,"I usually order Twinings tea, but I thought I'd try something different. This Celestial Seasonings version of English Breakfast is very good, and I will make it part of my usual rotation."
387028,B004EE2UR4,"Silvergriffin ""silvergriffin""",Best Variety,I've tried several brands of black tea and I liked this one the most because I liked the taste of it:  A) plain  B) with sugar  C) with lemon - iced or hot  D) cream  The others I tried had a slight (to me) floral taste that didn't mix well with cream or lemon.
387029,B004EE2UR4,JJRider,The best that I've tried of the K-Cup tea offerings,I've been drinking tea for years mostly for health reasons.  We recently bought a Keurig so I tried this black tea with our new brewer.  It had a nice full body taste and I found it had a better taste than the green tea varities I tried.
387030,B004EE2UR4,TJ,OMG!,"THIS IS SO GOOD!  I've had it hot and iced and am in love!  The chai flavor isn't overpowering, but you certainly know you are drinking a spiced tea!  I will definitely reorder!"
387031,B004EE2UR4,John McGuire,Very Good Iced tea too,I did not like any of the brew over iced tea flavors so i tried this and love it.  Would definately recommend for iced or hot tea.
387032,B004EE2UR4,GoldDove,Delicious tea,"I have always wanted to try brewing real English tea. I bought these for my Keurig, and they were so, so much better than my normal tea bags.  They may not be as good as real, brewed tea, but I think they're delicious."
